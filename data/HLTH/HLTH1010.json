There&#039;s a health &amp; fitness assessment but it became another online survey due to covid.<br /><br />Fitness Training (2 hours)<br />A lecture showing you how to use gym equipment. I attended that when school was still face to face, but if it is conducted online it would probably just turn into an online talk.<br /><br />Sports skill class (9 - 12 hours)<br />For your information, I took archery and golf. Due to covid, the classes were conducted online. You are required to show your face, but they won&#039;t check closely. Just turn on virtual background, cover your camera, and do anything you want.<br /><br />The face to face sports classes are much less chill as you have to actually show up and practice the sport.<br /><br />Enrolling the classes are tricky. In fall, you have to choose up to 10 classes, and they will allocate based on luck. If you&#039;re not given what you wanted, just wait until winter and spring, when enrollment is first come first served.<br /><br />Activities (23 - 26 hours)<br />There are 5 categories in this module (Additional Sports Skill Class, Organized Sports, Self Practice, Wellness &amp; Personal Enrichment (wellness talks), Community or Voluntary Work).<br /><br />I completed the requirement for this with sports skill class and wellness talks only because I&#039;m lazy. The wellness talks do not require camera so you&#039;re free to go AFK. I talked about the sports skill class in the previous section.<br /><br />Self practice is another great way to gain hours. You can go to the gym and just sit there, and you&#039;ll get a course hour. Don&#039;t leave too early or too late though, you will get no hours if you stay in the gym for less than an hour, and you can only get one hour each day no matter how long you sit.<br /><br />The actual content of the classes is meh.

Also it won’t be difficult for you to get a pass just if you don’t meet the peak of corona virus as all the sports facilities will be closed which implies that you have no choice for going to self-practice but to get zoom wellness classes which is very ideal to a student but not much from the course goal.",

      "comment_content": "This course is a one year course for freshmen (except you fail HLTH1010 before). You need to accumulate 45 course hours so that you can pass this course. Basically, it can be divided into 5 modules and you need to pass all of them. Otherwise, the number of course hours will be recounted in the coming academic year. Here are the modules:<br /><br />1) Orientation Module : Due to COVID-19, this became a 3 hour Zoom lesson. You will know the brief introduction of HLTH1010 and what sports skill classes you can apply for. You may also ask the instructor some questions if you have anything not understand. <br /><br />2) Wellness Module: Generally speaking, it is just some surveys and one fitness assessment. If you are doing the surveys fast, you can actually complete them under an hour for each of them. For the fitness assessment, it is just a series of test, like grip strength test, vertical jump test, 3-minute step test, etc.<br /><br />3) Fitness Training Module: It is a 2-hour lecture and the most important thing you can learn is how to properly use the equipment inside the gym rooms. <br /><br />4) Sports Sill Class Module: The most interesting part of the whole course. Usually, each sports skill class involve 8 lessons for one regular semester. Here are part of the sports skill class you can choose: karate, yoga, tennis, soccer, squash, archery, golf etc.<br /><br />5) Activities Module: It includes five sub-parts: Additional Sports Skill Class, Organized Sports, Self Practice, Wellness &amp; Personal Development, Community or Voluntary Work. I will briefly talk about Self Practice and Wellness &amp; Personal Development here.<br />Self Practice is just basically you go to the gym rooms in HKUST for one hour per day. Remember to check in and check out by putting your student ID card near the card reading machine.<br />Wellness &amp; Personal Development is basically talks and workshops. Usually you can enrol some of them every month, and even the orientation period before the commencement of each academic year.<br /><br />Here is the link to the HLTH1010 website if you want to know more.<br /><br />https://hlth1010.hkust.edu.hk/index.html<br /><br />At last, here is a list for you such that you will know how many course hours are required for passing each module (including maximum and minimum course hours required) :<br /><br />1) Orientation Module: Min: 3, Max: 3<br />2) Wellness Module: Min: 5, Max: 5<br />3) Fitness Training Module: Min: 2, Max: 2<br />4) Sports Skill Class Module: Min: 9, Max: 12<br />5) Activities Module: Min: 23, Max: 26<br /><br />Total minimum required course hour: 45",
      "comment_teaching": "Again, there are not much I can say. However, I think my experience would inspire some of you to choose karate class (especially for those who have a strong will to learn karate/try some new sports skills in university) and the major teaching part is from sports skill classes, so I will just mainly focus on that. <br /><br />I have chosen karate class and my instructor is called Thomas Lau. He has taught in HKUST since 1991 (yes, he has taught karate here since the establishment of HKUST and I knew that since he told me and my classmates during the class). I have done some research and I even found out that Master Lau has won many karate related awards before teaching in HKUST. He has obtained black belt (1st dan) since 1980. Although he is about 60 years old, he is still energetic and professional. He really taught us the interesting concepts and skills of karate. (He is also the instructor of HKUST Karate Club. You will possibly meet him if you join HKUST Karate Club.)<br /><br />I really enjoy the karate class as Master Lau is nice to all of us. He told us that the class was for beginners and just took it easy. In fact, that was true since for most of the time, you are doing warm up exercises (like stretching your arms and legs) before getting into the real part. Although the warm up exercise include jogging around the room and you may think it would be exhausting, this is not true as it is only lasts for about 5 minutes. To be true, even a few (slightly) fat classmates enrol this class and they seems not that exhausted after the warm up exercise. And of course, you will know about the importance of doing so many warm up exercise after Master Lau explain to you. He is really a whole-hearted master. :)<br /><br />Furthermore, Master Lau will regularly approach you to correct your posture other than just staying in front of the whole class for the whole lesson. That is why I say he is an excellent master to teach us karate. Indeed, he would usually have a lot of interaction with us and chat with us during the breaks. This further attract me to engage in the karate classes.<br /><br />In overall speaking, it is not necessary to remember all posture or skills of karate (as they are quite simple for me and you will automatically remember them if you pay attention to the class). Master Lau will help you to review what we have learnt last lesson. Furthermore, if you like to learn some karate to protect yourselves when you are in danger, Master Lau would probably be your best choice. :)<br /><br />(Additional Information: Here is the link to the HKUST Karate Club and you can find more details about Master Lau by clicking the button &quot;SENSEI&quot;: <br /><br />https://karat.su.ust.hk/<br /><br />)",

Just remember to regularly check your progress at myPortal and please always check emails so that you will never miss anything that is related to HLTH1010. You should be fine if you can do so. Passing all 5 modules should be quite easy if you are careful and smart. :)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update on 8 April, 2022<br /><br />Of course I pass HLTH1010. :)",
      "comment_workload": "It depends. <br /><br />If you are Mr Lazy/Miss Lazy, or you do not like doing exercises, you will think it is a heavy burden for you.<br /><br />However, if you like doing sports, or you do workouts regularly, then you will possibly think that this is just a piece of cake to complete and pass this course.<br /><br />For me, I do not find it challenging as I enjoy using the gym in HKUST and I want to go to there more frequently since they are new to me. In addition, I like playing with the training machines as I like to doing exercises in an air-conditioned environment. The sports skill class (karate) that I have applied is also very interesting since I have learnt many new and useful skills from Master Lau. <br /><br />The only tip I can give is: spread the work throughout the two regular semesters. Accumulating 45 hours is actually quite easy. Especially for the Activities Module, you can easily get 23 to 26 course hours if you join some workshops and talks that will count as HLTH1010 course hours, and exercise once/twice a week at gyms.<br /><br />(And most importantly, doing exercises regularly can make us stay healthy and strong. You do not want to be sick so often, right?)",

Organised sports (Max 14h): Sports team practice. If you find them your cup of tea, good for you.<br />c. Self sports practice (Max 14h): The &quot;tapping your student ID card&quot; activity. Easiest way to max out the required hours in this module. Whenever you&#039;re free, tap the card at any sports venue, and don&#039;t forget to wait for at least 45min to tap the card at the same place again.<br />d. Wellness &amp; personal enrichment (WPE, Max 14h): Workshops. Taking part in endorsed workshops by student organisations will do. There&#039;s really A LOT OF THEM that are worth your time.

It was like sex. But much, much better.<br /><br />We were practicing stretches when the instructor told me to get on my hands and knees. I was excited for my very first time. I was going to receive. Receive, that is, knowledge of how to exercise.<br /><br />&quot;Today,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be teaching you how to do push-ups.&quot; He continued to demonstrate the &quot;push-up&quot; a couple times.<br /><br />Eventually, it came our turn to try out these &quot;push-ups.&quot; I lowered my body slowly down onto the ground. I was tense and trying to keep my balance. My palms were sweaty. Knees weak, arms were heavy. There was vomit on my sweater already, mom&#039;s spaghetti.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t hold it any longer. I pushed myself up, and then I felt it. It was like my whole body had an orgasm, an orgasm I couldn&#039;t contain. It was pure ecstasy. It&#039;s the same confused, yet satisfying feeling when a little boy gets his first erection.

If you are unlucky enough like me, you will receive no offer after you make the enrollment, and then you need to pick up vacant quotas in &#039;leftover&#039; classes, usually dancing and football. I chose football(‘for begineers’), and it can be a little physically demanding if the instructor decides to let you play in the whole pitch on a hot, sunny day(but if not enough students show up he may ask us to play half the football pitch).",

For me, I joined some school year-long personal developments programs and participated in some volunteer activities(especially the Athletic Meet helper - 8 hours), and already gained 39.5 hours (including compulsory sessions) the end of fall term.

      "comment_teaching": "Before taking this class, I knew nothing. I was Jon Snow.<br /><br />What were these &quot;muscles&quot;? What was a &quot;gym&quot;? Fear not, this class will teach you everything you want to know on how to have a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />The seminar on how to enjoy a healthy lifestyle was very intriguing and informative. I learned many things. After the seminar, I have made drastic changes to my lifestyle. <br /><br />I am now gluten free. <br />I am also a vegan. <br /><br />There was also a seminar on why exercise is important, which came with a few demonstrations of how to perform various exercises. This was the moment that changed my life.<br /><br />The feeling of exercise is better than life itself. <br /><br />The pain.<br /><br />Oh, the pain, from working muscles you&#039;ve never discovered. It was like sex. But much, much better.<br /><br />We were practicing stretches when the instructor told me to get on my hands and knees. I was excited for my very first time. I was going to receive. Receive, that is, knowledge of how to exercise.<br /><br />&quot;Today,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be teaching you how to do push-ups.&quot; He continued to demonstrate the &quot;push-up&quot; a couple times.<br /><br />Eventually, it came our turn to try out these &quot;push-ups.&quot; I lowered my body slowly down onto the ground. I was tense and trying to keep my balance. My palms were sweaty. Knees weak, arms were heavy. There was vomit on my sweater already, mom&#039;s spaghetti.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t hold it any longer. I pushed myself up, and then I felt it. It was like my whole body had an orgasm, an orgasm I couldn&#039;t contain. It was pure ecstasy. It&#039;s the same confused, yet satisfying feeling when a little boy gets his first erection. It was love. It was life. It was Shrek.<br /><br />Needless to say, I had to change my undies before moving onto the next exercise.",

      "comment_workload": "The worst part of this course is getting up for sports skill class at 9am. It is the second hardest thing in the morning. If you have the option of doing so, go for ones in the afternoon. Or just take one in the Winter Semester.",

      "comment_workload": "too heavy<br />I don&#039;t know why there is no credits, but we need to bear such heavy workload. Before the commencement of the semester, we have to attend talks already. We always need to pay attention to emails for the deadlines. We need to register the sports skills class and the class lasts for 9 weeks. After that, we need to keep on completing the tasks / activities required by HLTH1010 office for counting 14 hours of this course.<br /><br />In my opinion, it should worth at least 1 credit. Even CUHK provides student with 1 credit after they have joined the sports class.",

Other than that, remember that your attendance to sports skill class is very important - and that it may end up causing you exhaustion after class.",
