    "description": "This course targets science students who have acquired basic knowledge in fundamental biology through HKDSE 1x Biology, AL/AS Biology or LIFS 1901. It functions as a bridging course to prepare the students for further study in life science. Its focus is on human biology, biotechnology and human impacts on the environment. Current examples will be used as well to relate the knowledge to real life issues. Students without the prerequisites but have completed biology course or program at equivalent level may seek instructor’s approval for enrollment.",

      "comment_teaching": "Liang tries his best to explain clearly by very physical means. For example, in one lecture he was explaining how tRNA folds up and he gave a live demo by pretending to be a tRNA molecule. Also, before every lecture he sings, and it doesnt even sound that bad. He is also a funny dude, in one lecture he went like &quot;I dont know if any of you have bought a house before...But it&#039;s pretty expensive&quot;. I forgot what he was talking about but this line stuck with me for some reason. Maybe because it&#039;s funny. <br /><br />Sarah has a very soothing voice, and pronounce every word crystal clear, maybe it&#039;s because she is British. In any case, I think she teaches quite well too. She will give some sample questions for our exam on lectures, so that&#039;s nice. But she will remove this questions from her ppt before uploading to canvas, so that the people who showed up for her lectures get a slight advantage over those who didn&#039;t, which is fair enough.<br /><br />I skipped most of Li&#039;s lectures, because by this point I was already quite bored about LIFS. But she is quite pretty in person, and that motivated me to study for a while, until it didn&#039;t. Regrettably, for the final exam, I didn&#039;t revise the part taught by her, and I am very sorry. One thing I will say, is that she need to work on her crowd control, in both times I showed up for her lectures, the class get very noisy, and she struggled to keep everyone silent. Maybe she just need experience, but she can do it, because Ho has an even softer voice than her but can still absolutely make everyone shut the fuck up.",
      "comment_grading": "I am not sure about how this course is graded, since they never disclose that information. However I can say the grading is very nice. I think I below mean for both midterm and final but somehow I still got B. Granted I am a phys maj who just come here to complete my sci school requirement, so if you intend on majoring LIFS, you must get a very good grade in this course.",
      "comment_workload": "Literally negative workload. No tutorial, lectures are skippable, no homework. In fact, the only workload comes from midterm and final, AND both exams are MC only (I hear this is only true for 1902 in fall). On top of that, the MCs are very easy provided that you studied, legit everything Ho asked in final were from her ppt. Again, I spent no more than three days revising for each exams and somehow I got B, so really, I can&#039;t recommend this course enough whether you just want to complete sci school requirement or is a serious LIFS maj or you want to appreciate the beauty of one of, if not the prettiest instructor in UST.",

      "comment_content": "Mentioned by other reviews so not gonna repeat<br /><br />The course is taught by 3 instructors, Dr. TANG, Dr. HO and Prof. MILLER, each for 4 weeks (topics). Unlike the Fall semester, when you go to have lectures and have a midterm and final, the arrangement in the Spring semester is completely different.<br /><br />You have some recorded lecture videos to view every week (around 90 minutes), finish the weekly online quiz, and go to weekly tutorials. There is a graded essay and a final exam.<br /><br />Jessica&#039;s topics tend to be much shorter (around 4x slides per topic), so at the first few weeks you may have a delusion that the course is very easy, on par of DSE level. But then things ramp up a lot. Sarah&#039;s and Miller&#039;s topics are much longer (around 100 slides), and you are expected to recite all of them. However, maybe this is the fate of LIFS major, to stuff a lot of thing into the brain, so I shall not blame too much about that. Indeed the content is quite interesting, that you will understand more about how our body works.",
      "comment_teaching": "Jessica: A; Sarah: D; Miller: B -&gt; D<br /><br />Jessica&#039;s tutorials are pretty chill and relaxing. Though she asked us to answer questions to receive participation marks, this has been never done. Each tutorial you get some theme-based tasks, which we can see the effort by her. There is like a story, or a background, and you discuss some questions with your groupmates.<br /><br />Sarah&#039;s tutorials are more like primary school lessons. She tried to entertain you with crossword puzzles and even Powerpoint-based stuff, but definitely no one is interested in that. Unlike Jessica&#039;s tutorials, I learnt nothing from Sarah&#039;s tutorials other than how to swiftly switch between windows, so I won&#039;t get caught doing my MATH assignment.<br /><br />Miller&#039;s tutorials are fine. You watch some youtube videos and your group only need to answer once every two weeks. It was quite relaxing. Also he didn&#039;t care what do we do in the tutorials, so feel free to treat it as a break.<br />However, I still have to give him a D because he couldn&#039;t reply to email properly and he typed my name wrong. Still seems like he has retired so forgive him.",
      "comment_grading": "Shit<br /><br />After getting two acceptable grades in other courses, I peeked into the USThing grade seciton again.<br /><br />B-???<br /><br />Are you fucking serious? I have put a lot of time into biology. Since high school, I put like hundreds, almost a thousand hours into biology, trying to recite the terms. I thought getting a 5** in Biology wouldn&#039;t mean a too bad grade. Also I put a lot of effort in LIFS1902. I viewed the lecture videos timely, put extra time per week to do revision and prepare lecture notes. In the exam period, more than half of the time I spent on this course.<br /><br />The rubrics was given in other reviews, but you only know how much you get in online quiz.<br /><br />(begin ranting UST)<br />In my opinion, grade opacity is as severe as grade deflation in UST. While the administrators can argue that grade deflation do not undermine students&#039; competitiveness, there should be no excuse for grade opacity. You receive a grade, but you never know how it is calculated, or each part of your performance, this sounds like as if you get raped while being blindfolded. Maybe fairness is neglected alongside students&#039; mental health and canteens&#039; food quality in UST.",

      "comment_teaching": "The 3 professors each have drastically different teaching styles. <br />Miller is very kind and entertaining. He explains the content clearly(well the content he teaches is generally easy to begin with) and frequently asks the class to revise/recall what he said during the lecture.<br />One thing to note about Miller: He really likes the details in his lectures. While his powerpoints may appear simple enough, every small detail(like the names of the two layers of connective muscle tissue and the formula for blood flow) will very likely end up on the exam. If Miller is teaching first, the very first lecture you will have in LIFS1902 will be something about psychoanalysis and psychology. Most people will think this content is useless and not pay attention in class. In fact, he WILL test you on stuff related to psychology, and it accounts for a sizeable portion of the exam questions(around 10-15). Even frivolous questions like who Konrad Lorenz or Simone de Beauvoir are will be asked. So make sure to memorize EVERYTHING from his powerpoints. <br /><br />Liang sure likes conceptual understanding and logical reasoning. He would frequently stop lectures to ask about why something occurs or why something is this and not that, then answers the question himself using logic. This will help you understand the concepts better but could get confusing at times.<br />Liang teaches the &quot;nitty gritty&quot; content of this course. His DNA and gene expression lecture(related to replication, transcription and translation, and cell control) is by far the hardest LIFS1902 lecture (to understand) you will experience and the questions asked by him in this module are the most difficult(I probably got many of those questions wrong). <br /><br />Li&#039;s teaching is a bit more &quot;generic&quot; than Liang&#039;s and Miller&#039;s. Apparently she&#039;s much newer to teaching this course; I still think her teaching&#039;s fine, just not as &quot;engaging&quot; as Miller or Liang. She allows students to directly ask questions on Canvas mid-lecture and answers these questions in-class, which could be helpful in conceptual understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, unlike Miller, you do not have to remember every detail she puts in her powerpoints; it&#039;s impossible if you do. The content she teaches is generally easier than Liang&#039;s but still covers a lot of new content not necessarily covered in high school biology. The questions she asks in the final exam are also easier than Liang&#039;s, although it would only be easy if you fully memorized all the important details in her lecture. <br /><br />In my opinion(all 3 are good instructors though):<br />Nature of content(how easy is it to understand and remember): Miller &gt; Li &gt; Liang (except for that weird psychology lecture Miller gave)<br />Teaching quality: Miller &gt; Liang &gt; Li<br />Difficulty of content: Liang &gt; Miller = Li",

In my opinion, that&#039;s not good. <br />You would find this very aggravating especially if you tend to get nervous or mess up during examinations because there is no other way to redeem your score if you do poorly in exams. But I guess most LIFS lecture courses are like that due to how many people take them, smh...<br /><br />For me:<br />Midterms: 89.33% (67/75)<br />Finals: Unknown<br />Grade: A+",

Go through and re-write your notes, use the textbook to your advantage(if you bought it, if not that&#039;s still okay), watch the extra videos for Liang&#039;s content while making sure you understand his main concepts, re-watch Li&#039;s lectures if you&#039;re confused about some of the content, and photocopy all of Miller&#039;s taught lecture powerpoints into your brain(this works because Miller will give questions about content found exclusively in his powerpoints and nothing else).

      "comment_teaching": "MILLER:<br />My favorite part in bio is human physiology, so Miller&#039;s lectures where very enjoyable and easy to learn. There was new content not covered in IB Bio, but they are not complicated. WARNING: Miller has a whole lecture on psychology/pschoanalysis and lots of seemingly unrelated info on Nobel prizes/random facts. GET THAT RANDOM INFO DOWN. Being fluent in English helps immensely with this. If you are not fluent in English, you will need to memorize these facts. Fortunately, Miller&#039;s ppt&#039;s are comprehensive and required little additional notes. Miller&#039;s pace is also slower than the other two profs, which is good for learning but he doesn&#039;t finish planned content. He only tests on taught content, so no worries.<br />Miller also has a strong sense of humor that some<br />absolutely love and others find unbearably distracting. I loved it.<br /><br />LI:<br />Her ppts includes a lot of images and diagrams, but lack words. I had to rewatch lecture videos and type out notes. Li&#039;s sentences don&#039;t flow as smoothly as Miller&#039;s (I suppose because she has less experience). This is not a problem during lessons, but becomes one when having to type out notes. Rewatching lecture and typing out notes was very frustrating and unnecessarily time-consuming, especially since typing out all key points during lectures is practically impossible. However, Li is very kind and willing to answer students questions.<br /><br />LIANG<br />Clear passion and difficult content. His ppts contain a good amount of content, but not everything, so rewatching and typing out notes is definitely needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the content very difficult in comparison with Miller&#039;s and Li&#039;s, however (I imagine) it is the basis of the rest of the biology classes. Liang also includes brief Chinese/Cantonese idioms/sayings to explain certain things. It&#039;s just an extra and does not (at least from what I see) affect the understanding of non-Chinese speakers. Despite how much I like Liang&#039;s teaching, I found studying his content an absolute pain",

It goes from physiology to DNA and inheritance. I don&#039;t think it is the typical order of learning Biology but there&#039;s nothing else to do rather than accept it. The part taught by Prof MILLER and LI is basic physiology. Part of the contents taught by Prof. LIANG overlaps with the contents in senior high (mainland)(It&#039;s like the English version of it, but of course a little more in-depth). The vocabulary may be larger compared with other subjects, but it is acceptable once you get familiar with the prefixes and word roots, etc.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. MILLER is kind and just like your grandpa. His lectures are engaging and interesting. But his slides is a bit unorganized and he taught about lots of &#039;useless&#039; and &#039;unnecessary&#039; staff like the people winning Nobel Prize etc. The lecture on Nerves is totally transformed into psychiatry, about Freud and other mental illnesses. HOWEVER those seemingly &#039;useless&#039; staff will appear in your midterm exam(even the female writer that wrote against Freud). So try to remember everything covered.<br /><br />Prof. LI is young and seems to be new in teaching. Her class is not so engaging as her tones seldom rise or drop and she seems to be not so familiar with the content. But her ppts are neat, and the structure is very clear. There are many pictures on her ppt, which are important for having a good understanding of the stuff she is talking about. Pictures didn&#039;t occur in the exams but you&#039;d better study and memorize them. In my opinion, her exam questions are not so straightforward as prof. MILLER and is more challenging. It&#039;s easy to get confused.<br /><br />Prof. LIANG&#039;s accent is a little strange but it doesn&#039;t affect understanding. He usually raises some questions for students to think about. The questions are worth thinking. Sometimes he gives the answer, but sometimes he didn&#039;t state it quite clearly either. It greatly improves my ability to search for relative materials to find reasonable explanations. Some of the questions may appear in the test. His ppts are just fine.",

His explanations are easy to understand and very smooth. His lecture slides can sometimes be a bit repetitive but I think it only helps to consolidate my knowledge which helps students to memorise and remember difficult concepts along the way (good for revision)<br /><br />Li&#039;s lecture slides are straight to the point, so if you by any chance were late to the lecture, just go through her slides and you will be fine. <br /><br />Liang hasn&#039;t taught us for general bio II yet but he is also very good in Biochemistry I. He makes his lectures interesting by rhetorically asking students questions which encourages students to be open-minded",

      "comment_teaching": "MILLER:<br />My favorite part in bio is human physiology, so Miller&#039;s lectures where very enjoyable and easy to learn. There was new content not covered in IB Bio, but they are not complicated. WARNING: Miller has a whole lecture on psychology/pschoanalysis and lots of seemingly unrelated info on Nobel prizes/random facts. GET THAT RANDOM INFO DOWN. Being fluent in English helps immensely with this. If you are not fluent in English, you will need to memorize these facts. Fortunately, Miller&#039;s ppt&#039;s are comprehensive and required little additional notes. Miller&#039;s pace is also slower than the other two profs, which is good for learning but he doesn&#039;t finish planned content. He only tests on taught content, so no worries. <br />Miller also has a strong sense of humor that some <br /> absolutely love and others find unbearably distracting. I loved it. <br /><br />LI:<br /> Her ppts includes a lot of images and diagrams, but lack words. I had to rewatch lecture videos and type out notes. Li&#039;s sentences don&#039;t flow as smoothly as Miller&#039;s (I suppose because she has less experience). This is not a problem during lessons, but becomes one when having to type out notes. Rewatching lecture and typing out notes was very frustrating and unnecessarily time-consuming, especially since typing out all key points during lectures is practically impossible. However, Li is very kind and willing to answer students questions. <br /><br />LIANG<br />Clear passion and difficult content. His ppts contain a good amount of content, but not everything, so rewatching and typing out notes is definitely needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the content very difficult in comparison with Miller&#039;s and Li&#039;s, however (I imagine) it is the basis of the rest of the biology classes. Liang also includes brief Chinese/Cantonese idioms/sayings to explain certain things. It&#039;s just an extra and does not (at least from what I see) affect the understanding of non-Chinese speakers. Despite how much I like Liang&#039;s teaching, I found studying his content an absolute pain",

Comparing to the previous content, the complexity was like an abrupt turn.<br /><br />The concepts of topics he taught were very very challenging, remarkably hard to understand and too many to be memorized. If you can&#039;t understand the concept there is no way you know his questions in the exam.<br /><br />His teaching is intriguing, he will ask many questions related to the content and allow the student to think.

However he will exclude some content in his ppts and mention them in class, and of course they will be seen in the test. <br /><br />Li:<br />Acceptable teaching, she just basically explains the content on her ppts.<br /><br />Liang:<br />As the course director, Prof. Liang will include some critical thinking questions in class for students to answer, some of which are interesting and meaningful for lifs students, and they might be explained in more advanced lifs courses. These questions could end up in the final exam!<br />Prof. Liang explains his lectures pretty clear, but not as interesting as Prof. Miller. <br /><br />My overall rating: Miller&gt;Liang&gt;Li",

BEWARE OF ALL THE NAMES IN MILLER&#039;S LECTURES! EVEN THE NON_SCIENTISTS! For example, in our midterm there was s question asking about who Simone de Beauvoir was.

By the way, if you have any questions, he will be happy to answer you even if he sometimes murmured the questions were too much.<br /><br />Dr Li is a young woman so she is not that experienced in teaching compared to other two instructors. One tips is that her slides includes too many concepts and she will only put the concepts mentioned in the lectures in the exam. So you should pay more attention during the lecture because she will not underline which one is important in her materials.<br /><br />Prof Liang&#039;s slides are well organized making it easier to be understood. But you should spend more time on his slides because the part he tought was the hardest in 1902 (not that hard if you have learned the fundamental DNA and inherit when you are in high school, likes students from mainland choosing biology in JEE).

I think it is partly due to the fact that the topics he is in charge is easier compared with the other two professors.<br /><br />Li, Laam is standard. She makes some jokes and gives you a break during lecture. However, what I do not like is her terrible powerpoints; she just copies photos from getty images and shutterstock and leaves a line of description. The point is that there are tons of useless content within those photos and you need to work hard to differentiate what is useless and what is not. So the best thing to do is to attend every of her lessons.<br /><br />Liang&#039;s lecture is not really brilliant. His lecture is the most difficult one to be understood. It is understandable because the topics he is in charge is the most difficult one. However, his powerpoints are more organized than Li Laam&#039;s. But still, not very organized, which adds workload to organize them. Be noted, however, that his exam questions are very very difficult.

And his exam Q is tricky and not as straight forward as miller&#039;s and raymond&#039;s.<br /><br />Raymond:<br />He talks very slowly in class and he always can&#039;t finish the slides in the lectures (bear in mind that he has retired and is just helping some parts of the course). He includes some extra information in the biochemistry field since he is the expert of that. But his exam is not as hard since most of the time extra content is not involved. If u like to know more and love research, u may like liang&#039;s and raymond&#039;s lectures.<br /><br />In terms of difficulty and preparation to get high marks in exam:<br />Miller&lt;Raymond&lt;&lt;&lt;Liang",

      "comment_teaching": "Miller is enthusiastic in teaching, however, you can’t simply understand the ppt if you do not attend his lectures because he tends to insert quite a lot of pictures and types less words, so you have to listen carefully to make sure what is meant by each slide. (His ppts are different from the ones he posted on canvas but he will upload the full version before exam) Also, he teaches fast. Somehow it is hard to catch up for me.<br /><br />Raymond’s teaching pace is slower than the other two, he loves to share his research results to us. Regarding his teaching, his ppt is quite confusing because he just copies the slides from google and insert them into his ppt without clear organization. Again, make sure you attend his lectures if you want to understand what is going on.<br /><br />Liang chun is responsible for teaching us the DNA and biotechnology parts, he loves to ask students questions during classes (but it’s not relate to the exam). His ppt is easy to be followed, but some of the details he will not include in his ppt (which will be examined), make sure you jot notes during his lectures.<br /><br />Luckily, the videos will be posted on canvas so it is a good new for those who do not attend lectures.",

I fell asleep several times when I am having his lectures. Probably because of his word pace is too slow. Maybe the best part is that he never finishes his ppt. Less content for revision. Also, he frequently gets off-tracked by himself and repeats what he has mentioned before.<br /><br />Professor Tang: A really kind-hearted lecturer. She holds tutorials for us, which is good.

      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Liang and Dr. Lam are local who&#039;s English&#039;s above average (among all local Prof. here). Prof. Liang is good at raising questions in your mind.(Cuz foundational knowledge on certain concepts are missing on ppt e.g. why DNA replication goes from 5&#039; to 3&#039;, instead, it would only be taught in class. Unfortunately, for most of the students that sleep in class, they will find it extremely difficult to follow up)<br /><br />Dr. Lam is a nice guy, before class, he would send you a notification email about the topics he&#039;ll teach. Also, he would send a summary abt the topics he taught soon after class.<br /><br />Herrup is a foreign Prof. that should deserve more respect. He&#039;s actually an expert in neuroscience and was on a TV show before(you can just search it on YouTube). I don&#039;t think it is useful to say much abt him here.",

The final exam is much much much much easier that mid-term.(to me it was...cuz you don&#039;t have to deal with DNA)<br /><br /><br />Just for your reference:<br />My mid-term score: (37/50)<br />Final score: Unknown…(You will never know...)(Though I made a little calculation that I only got one question wrong&gt;&lt;)<br />Overall score:A (Could have been A+ if I didn&#039;t screw up my mid-term)",

      "comment_content": "If you&#039;ve done IB biology HL, this course is going to be kinda nice. Some parts have much more detail than the IB content and some parts are gonna have much less so it balances out.<br /><br />Get ready to memorize a lot for this course, especially for the developmental biology, and then get ready to have a deep understanding of biological theories and systems, especially for endocrinology and evolution. <br /><br />Overall, it&#039;s a standard biology course that just needs lots of revision and memorization. I&#039;d definitely suggest studying from the textbook (you can find the pdf version from higher year students) off the written chapters as well as the PPT lectures notes BUT, only study the textbook parts that have been mentioned in the lecture notes first (textbook has lots of excess information) <br /><br />Here&#039;s the general outline of the course<br /><br />Introduction; DNA structure and gene expression (25)<br />Patterns of Gene Inheritance (23); Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance (24)<br />Development (22)<br />Reproduction (21)<br />Endocrine System (20)<br />Evolution (27)<br />Aging (22)<br />Circulatory System (12)<br />Respiratory System (15)<br />Lymphatic, Immune Systems &amp; Infectious Diseases (13)<br />Osmoregulation &amp; Excretion (16)<br />Digestive System and Nutrition (14)<br />Biotechnology (26)<br />Nervous System<br />Aging",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor Herrup is an absolutely amazing lecturer. He speaks very fluently with a sense of passion about the topic and gets all excited about the content that he&#039;s lecturing on, which is always great. With all that being said, his PPTs/lecture notes are EXTREMELY confusing and disordered to the point where even he himself gets all confused as to what he&#039;s supposed to talk about next. Maybe it&#039;s a good technique for forcing students to show up to the lecture, since the notes make no sense otherwise. Make sure to jot down the things he says, they&#039;re pretty interesting even if they don&#039;t come up on the finals. (He asks general questions about what biology is all about and how systems interact with each other that some find hard but I find more useful)<br /><br />Professor Lam is great. Clear speaking, clear lecture notes, a really sweet guy. Again, there&#039;s a small issue with how he controls the noise level in the lectures, aka, he doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />Professor Liang looks really experienced in his field and very passionate for his work in genetics and cancer research HOWEVER he&#039;s just not a good lecturer. Simple as that. Not everyone can handle a class of 300 people while speaking eloquently, it&#039;s a fact. Just study from the textbook and his PPTs it&#039;s all good (He asks lots of questions in the exam that need only memorization)",
      "comment_grading": "The exams are almost identical to the IB Biology Paper 1, so kinda tricky and not so straight forward. I personally like the way they&#039;re written since it rewards students who spend time actually learning rather than memorizing a bunch of content like zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is one mid-term (50%) and one final (50%), each containing their own half of the semester with approximately 5MCQs from each lecture. There&#039;s 52-54 questions.<br /><br />I got an A overall but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that easy to get an A range since most people around me who did well in the exams ended up with a B/<br /><br />-Midterms I got a 42/50 with mean 32.7 out of 50 and a SD of 8.0 <br /><br />-Finals I&#039;m almost sure I got around 51/54 but the actual scores were never released.",

The course does not take attendance and provides lecture videos to students who miss the lecture, which is very helpful.<br /><br />Both are in the similar level of difficulty, but due to relative scoring you should not expect getting a very high score in this course.",

      "comment_teaching": "Prof Liang is funny and has extensive knowledge on the subjects of DNA/biotech. He often likes to ask students in lecture, and focuses on asking/explaining the experimental ways through which discoveries are made. Although he often reads from the powerpoints, he explains things well.<br />Prof Herrup is same, funny and likes to keep things interesting during lectures with his funny expression and analogies. The only thing is that you should attend his lec/watch the video as he often talks more than he puts in the slides. Also he has some extra &quot;fun&quot; facts in ppts, so its helpful to go to lecture and figure out what is imp for exam.<br />Both prof are helpful to answer questions after lectures as well.",
      "comment_grading": "One midterm (50%) and one final (50%), the percentage can vary based on instructors.<br />We had both exams as multiple choice, and multiple answer type questions.<br />The mean grade is around B-, which is pretty good since it doesnt require too much effort.",

If you study well for the exam and go to lecture/watch lecture video it should be fine.<br />For students with weak english, it might be hard to cope up with the vocab sometimes, but you get used to it eventually and the instructors are understanding of that.",

Not much to learn here, and the lectures are perfectly skippable. Not that you could 吃中學老本, but the workload here is near zero compared to Herrup&#039;s part.",
      "comment_teaching": "I intended to give an A here because of Prof Herrup but a C for Dr Tang, so here it is, a B.<br />Many would say Professor Herrup speaks way too fast and covers too many complex course contents, but seriously I think this is just the way native speakers teach. It is simply natural for the professor to try and share as much as his knowledge to students.<br />Dr. Tang, meanwhile, is a typical Hong Kong lecturer. She speaks with a pretty Hongkong-ish accent you might find......rather.......hypnotizzzing. Well in her defense she got the way less interesting part, i.e. human physiology, a topic largely overlapping with DSE biology.",

These questions make up 20 marks in each exam.<br /><br />Not sure about the grading since it was kind of irrelevant to me, but here are some stats.<br />76.4% midterm, &gt;2.4 SD, mean 49.6%, max 84%<br />87.2% final, mean 54.8% iirc<br />--&gt; A+.",

After you take it you&#039;ll either feel like biology is your calling (if you like memorization and you see how useful studying biology is) or it&#039;s the grossest thing you&#039;ll ever study (especially for people who hate memorization).

You&#039;ll hear him talking about history, the arts... etc (and no they won&#039;t appear in the final so don&#039;t worry about memorizing old abortion drug names)<br />His teaching is decently interesting, and you&#039;ll definitely live without the coffee.<br />I just feel like he&#039;s not very approachable when it comes to questions after class.

This course is really about human biology, diseases, and the central dogma (DNA, mRNA and protein -- you know it).<br /><br />The anatomy part requires some good language sense, and memorization is of course inevitable. Diseases are incredibly fun and not as difficult to study as you might imagine. The developmental biology, though, requires extensive Wikipedia reading and emailing Prof Herrup. It&#039;s extremely time-consuming, but the joy from understanding these processes makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />To be fair though, people who are gonna work at research labs for UROP will probably find this course mostly, if not completely, useless. It&#039;s not very helpful for biochemistry courses later on too I guess. So unless you wanna transfer to medical schools (for which this course is near-perfect), just think of the contents as something good to know, and no pressure really.",

His lectures are fantastically delivered in a fun, interactive and clear manner.
