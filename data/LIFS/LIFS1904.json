It provides students with some basic concepts and hands-on experience in biological investigation within the areas covered by LIFS 1902, including plant biology, human biology and ecology. The emphasis is on the understanding and application of the  scientific principles underlying the experiments. Graded P or F. For students in their first and second year of study; or third and fourth year students with instructor's approval.",

Sometimes, it is difficult to get what she is saying. But luckily, what she said can be found on lab manual or you can ask TAs for help. TAs are really really nice!!!But be careful that some changes in the conc of chemicals will only be announced during briefing.<br /><br />There is some video recording and displaying on what is occurring on the briefing stage. This is one of the good point about this course. But again, the filming skills is ...... hard to explain...... Also, one of the accents of the technician who is sometimes responsible for demonstration is quite heavy and it is hard to catch what he is saying. <br /><br />Reason why I finally give B is that professor and all the technicians and TAs are really helpful!!! Feel free to ask them questions (if necessary). The TAs responsible for my bench is Jessica and Clooney who are really helpful and nice!!!!

And bundle your long hairs!! Otherwise, marks will be deducted.<br /><br />The score for final exam is not revealed. But I think the exam is quite easy as most of the questions appeared can be found on lab manual.<br /><br />Finally, I get A+ (I get A- in LIFS1902).

Lab reports (Esp lab reports 2&amp;3 which are take-home assignment. Everytime I handed in the lab report, I was afraid that I missed any important points and kept adding staff onto the reports)<br />2. Final exams (I only study lab manual and ppt one afternoon and night before start of the exam)<br />I rmb that in the exam, no scientific name of flies is asked. But in MCs, conc of TAE (knowing how to find it is ok when going through ppt) and name of TAE was asked. I remember only 1 questions in lab procedures was asked.",

I recommend you to take your own mask to Lab 1-Rat dissection lab. The rat smells very badly and they do not provide masks.",
      "comment_teaching": "you only have to read Presentation slides. They explain the presentation slides and cautions before the lab starts. Lab presentation covers most part of the LIFS1902 chapters. It is quiet boring.",
      "comment_grading": "It is pass or fail. Most of students get passes unless you miss the labs. you attend all the labs and just make sure that you go for final exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all are multiple choice questions. For my case, I got a pass.There is no midterm, which is the best part of this course. :)",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is moderate. you have to team up with 3 more people and work with them together. They allow you to choose your labmate and have to confirm them on canvas. If you dont have labmate to work with, dont worry! The instructors will form a group for you! <br /><br />Also, you have to pay attention to lab results since you have to submit the lab result right after the lab ends. <br /><br />You go to lab twice a week. I prefer you reading the material before the lab is very helpful( It is still okay even if you do not read. But, to be confident, just read them and go. otherwise, you will feel lost). <br />I personally think it should be at least 2 credits because just 1 credit is too less for this much of workload.",

      "comment_content": "The content is related to Lifs1902, only with more things to be recited. For example, students are required to identify every bit of the rat&#039;s organ.",
      "comment_teaching": "The tutor has a funny accent and often speaks Chinglish without he noticing. Although being a HongKonger like him, I seldom need to guess what he just said. Often spends a long time (e.g. 40 mins) to talk about the experiment and the principal before starting it, which is pretty boring. Do pay close attention to it, as those will appear in the final exam. <br /><br />And don&#039;t let him catch you doing anything wrong in the experiment, or you may get your marks deducted. Try to ask the TAs instead if you have any questions.",
      "comment_grading": "I got a pretty bad grade as I didn&#039;t know that questions asked in the final would not be solely based on the experiments, but also the principals. Please make sure that you read every bit (not joking) of those powerpoints, or you may risk getting c range in this course.",
      "comment_workload": "The course is very demanding. First of all. students are required to do a lab report after each lab, in which some of them are take-home assignments. Though students have 2 weeks to complete that, it is hard to get a high marks. <br /><br />The final is a disaster - it includes questions that you will never expect. For instance, students need to spell the scientific name of sea monkey, which the tutor only mentioned once during lessons. As I said, you need to pay attention in class and recite the ppts, or else you will end up staring at the exam paper and start guessing the answer of the mcs ( like me).",

The only thing useful about enzymatic assay is that you gotta know how to operate a pipetteman, which honestly a third grader can learn in 2 minutes. DNA gel electrophoresis -- concept is good since it&#039;s routinely used in research labs too, but the techniques taught are just wrong (e.g. NEVER EVER add DNA samples above the wells -- add them into the friggin wells). Oh and the resulting UV-exposed photo usually doesn&#039;t show good results, sometimes because of poor exposure by the technicians (you&#039;ll know after one or two times at research labs). Genetics is kind of boring, and scary for those who fear arthropods. Toxicity analysis is kind of brutal too, just watching those little creatures suffocating and dying in the toxic solutions.<br />What&#039;s worse, you wait and wait and wait and chat and chat and chat until you&#039;ve got nothing more to chat about and the wall starts to become really interesting.",
