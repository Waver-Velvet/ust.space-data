      "comment_content": "This course is the final year project research of the Biotech major. Students are needed to choose a supervisor from the division of LIFS and join his/her lab. The content depends on the project you initiate. It is just similar to UROP. Though the purpose of FYP is to give chance to students to join a lab and have some exposure to research, I guess most of the students have already joined UROP before or being volunteer in a lab already.",
      "comment_teaching": "It depends on your supervisor. My supervisor is great and encouraging.",
      "comment_grading": "It depends on your supervisor. I guess in general it should be good grading as Final Year Project can no need follow strictly the grading system of UST and gives more than 25% A range. As your supervisor should also know you are already a final year student pending graduation, I guess most of them should be kind to grading. Final year project is a one year long course, you are only required to submit an introduction to your own project in Fall semester. For the grading, I think it really depends. Some supervisor may grade purely on the introduction report of the FYP, while some may require you present during the lab meeting and grade based on your presentation and introduction report. <br /><br />My grade: A+ <br /><br />I guess most of the professors should be lenient in FYP in terms of grading.",
      "comment_workload": "Again, it depends. You should contact and meet your supervisor frequently for your own project. You should be actively engaging in the project while you also can choose to sleep for the whole semester. Research always depends on your own initiative and passion.",
