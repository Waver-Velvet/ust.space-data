    "description": "This course will provide a survey of Neuroscience and Neuroengineering research areas to provide our research postgraduate students a broad appreciation of interdisciplinary research in context. The course aims to help student recognize and understand how knowledge from science and engineering interface in this interdisciplinary application. Concepts such as neural interfacing and neural prosthesis will be introduced so that students can understand the impact of the latest technologies. The course will enhance the vision of the students and encourage them to work in future inter-disciplinary research fields.",

Present a simple group presentation on a specific topic. Then, write an essay related to the topic, which should be around two pages long. The essay presents some challenges for students, as they need to not only introduce the development but also express their own opinions about the topic. Failure to do so will result in a significantly lower grade. Additionally, the grading criteria for the essay is not fixed, to some extent it depends on your luck.",
