I believe I am more like taking a course related to engineering. I should quit science school and go to study CIVL after taking this course.<br /><br />The course can be divided into 2 main parts:<br /><br />1. SIPE (Science In Plain English)<br />What do you have to do? Prepare some props and demonstrate some science knowledge to general audiences. How old? Around 15 maybe. <br /><br />2. Natural Disasters<br />Come on! This course is called English for Science. But in the end I feel more like I am doing something related to engineering.<br /><br />You are required to analysize an natural disaster in a scientific way. So you know what it will be ended up, which is, engineering related stuff.",

I thanked my instructor for working so hard these days for marking all the assignments done in this semester, including SIPE and individual report. <br /><br />I suddenly remembered Yan Min, who also release all the score few days after the final exam. I suspect Yan Min also took few days after final to mark all the midterm and final paper. However, considering that Yan Min leaves his office at 6 o&#039;clock exactly, I believe this is impossible.<br /><br />Anyway, when I open the CLE&#039;s potato-server hosted webpage that takes at least 1 minutes to load, I see the following grade:<br /><br />SIPE: 5 5 5<br />Interim Presentation: 5 5 5.5<br />Individual Recommendation Report: 4.5 4.5 5<br /><br />Then I got a B. Not bad grade but still not good grade at all.<br /><br />Still, I would like to thank my instructor for his effort in marking all assignments. That&#039;s it. After LANG3021 I will no longer need any LANG courses. Thankfully it will not be counted in MCGA or I&#039;ll be f**ked up.",

You have no choice right (Other than DSCT, you can also choose LANG2030(H)).<br /><br />Let me give you some preperation. The workload is quite large. In the 3 months you need to do a 3-min video and a individual report around 1500 words. ChatGPT is allowed but considered the fact that it gave me bullsh*t, I consider not using this tool for my assignment.",

This is good because if you really follow his instruction, it is guaranteed to get high marks. He gave marks objectively and reasonably.<br /><br />For the group projects, he gave clear instructions and freedom that he doesn&#039;t mind if your presentation exceeded time a bit. He won&#039;t stop you from speaking so you dun need to worry about the time limit, which makes me perform better.<br /><br />For the recommendation report, he also gave us more freedom that we can write 1700 words at maximum. It was stated in the task sheet that we can&#039;t write more than 1500 words. But i think he knew it&#039;s very easy to exceed words so he gave more freedom. You can sense that he is a logical person. He wants you to be evidence-based and specific enough. If you are able to do so in your report, you can score high definitely.",

I am lucky to find good groupmates with that we all participated (no free-riders)<br />The final task is the recommendation report. Make sure you write it specifically and evidence-based.",

      "comment_teaching": "Liza is a very nice person. She would have share some interesting thing with us at the beginning of the lesson to make us be more relax. Like the interesting things about her dogs. She is also passionate in teaching and willing to answer our questions. During the class, she would encourage us to express our ideas. Which I think it is good, providing a chance to let us chat in English.<br /><br />Liza is also willing to listen our concern regarding the assignment. Say the SIPE assignment, she hope us can complete the script before the due day. So that she can have a look at the content, and give us some feedback that whether we are off the track or not. She will try her best to answer your concern.",

      "comment_workload": "I think the workload is acceptable. Before each lesson, there will be a pre-unit task to let you have a brief idea about what is going to teach in the lesson. <br />Through out the course, pre-unit task each lesson. 3 task, 2 are individual, 1 is group work.

      "comment_content": "If I could, I would tell people to not take this course but this option is not available for the unlucky victims in the school of Science <br /><br />As many has stated before, the instructor has neither a scientific background nor any relevant knowledge<br /><br />No useful information can be gleamed from the curse (It’s a typo but I see no need in fixing it), and I’m saying this as someone who will begrudgingly admit that LANG 1002 and 1003 have taught useful skills for the future, though they are a waste of time. They supposed purpose of the course is to teach you how to communicate science to the public which it tried teaching in some way but not effectively, some course contents are scientifically questionable, especially using a video from the Union of Concerned Scientists, a well known anti-GMO advocacy group, related to GMO, despite the organisation being well known for being against the scientific consensus about GMO. The course also limits the solution provided for the recommendation report for a natural disaster to be “scientific”, in reality they mean science-ish, it is a great practice for aspiring science fiction writers, who wish to have their story based on hardish science. Never in my life have I become so disgusted at the word “scientific” being spoken out of a human mouth. I’ve put so many buzzwords in my report, some clueless billionaires reading will be planning to invest in the BS I came up with.<br /><br />(-100)/10, if there was a way to not take this course and still graduate, this course will have no enrolment",
      "comment_teaching": "Given the absolute trainwreck of a course this is, Anita did a pretty decent job teaching the language concepts that is in the course, even though any new contents are completely useless outside of the course. The advice provided in discussions (both in class and 1 on 1 consultations) are genuinely useful for improving my writing. There are also an abundance of group discussions in breakout room that we can use to discuss with group mate how much of a s***show the course is, other courses and just plain chitchat, if it wasn’t for the amount of time required for the course or the abysmally awful content, the course may have been enjoyable",
      "comment_grading": "At least in my opinion, the grading was fair if not a little tough. My SPIE (Science In Plain English) recorded short speech is admittedly not my best work, and the mark reflected that, though having background noises are unavoidable if your family members just insist on sorting out the 10 million plastic bags in the living room while you are recording instead of just shutting up and waited for like 20 minutes and your room is unavailable because your idiot of a brother fell of a motorcycle and had to get stitches on his right arm and leg, and there are no other available room in the house. (I think I’ve gone on a tangent here but I’m to lazy to fix this). <br /><br />The report on the other hand was a masterpiece of complete and utter BS, no more meaningless words have been cobbled together to create something that looks so amazing yet is totally devoid of any real or practical solutions, if you have even a speck of relevant knowledge, you will either be laughing your a** off or facepalmming at such a thing existing. One of the references was an article with the word “shit” in the title, referring to actual feces, the data from that article did not add much useful information and can be found elsewhere easily but where is the fun in that? Did I spend way to much time on a joke that no one will notice? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely, after all, the summary of the course’s quality can be found in a word in the title of a reference from a report of a student.<br /><br />The best part is that the report earned a relatively high mark as while the actual “scientific” contents are questionable (not that the instructor would notice, see the content section and multiple other reviews), the language and grammar was to a relatively high standard, a standard that is befitting of a person who took English Language &amp; Literature for his A Levels as his “fun” elective.",
      "comment_workload": "Despite the aforementioned lack of substance in course content, the workload is unreasonably high, high enough that it may interfere with the time you need to study other lectures, especially if you are the kind of person whose ADHD would lead you to Alpha Centauri and back when researching something or spend an ungodly amount of time for one stupid little joke (the emphasis is on the little) that no one will ever notice if they aren’t actively looking for it. The SPIE took some work while the report requires a lot of research even when just half a**ing it for a decent grade. In all honesty, if I failed any of my actual course, this course is responsible.",

      "comment_grading": "除了慣常的行兇手法 (individual case study preliminary report 20%, group case study presentation 30%, group case study final report 25%, iPeer 5%, participation 5%) 外, LANG2010還採取了一種新的行兇手法, 名為Vocabulary and Extensive Reading Project (VERP, 見pdf檔), 不但要求事主繳交合共5份, 每2星期1份的vocab lists及flashcards (共5%, 每份1%), 更要求事主在Week 8堂上口頭匯報VERP進度 (verbal learning progress report, 5%), 並在Week 14繳交一份450-550字的反思報告 (reflective report, 5%), 值得一提的是, 口頭匯報是會錄影的, 而反思報告是會經Turnitin檢查有否抄襲, 有關安排可謂居心叵測<br /><br />LANG2010謀殺事主GPA的手法相當純熟, 只公佈了individual case study preliminary report (20%) 的分數 (5/4/6/5 = 20/28), final grade顯示為 “B”, 令事主的GPA死無對證<br /><br />躲在LANG2010背後的爛grade集團LANG Center經常強調LANG courses (特別是英LANG) 可以提升事主的語文水平, 事實卻是欠缺透明度, 經常不公佈任何分數, 也不給予writing/speaking assessment的評語, 往往只有一個letter grade而已, 事主根本無法從LANG courses中獲得有用的意見和分數作出改善, 更遑論提升語文水平, LANG Center應立即停止有關 &quot;LANG courses有助提升語文水平&quot; 的癡心妄想<br /><br />先不談LANG2010的workload大得不合理, 連最基本的分數和評語也欠奉, 又何談提升英語水平? 可見LANG2010的存在意義與普通的pass/fail courses (如HLTH1010) 根本無異, 目的是為事主的學業添煩添亂, 其擾民本質顯而易見",
      "comment_workload": "事主當然不希望fail LANG2010要retake, LANG2010當中佔85%的course grade暫且不談, 單是1份僅佔1%的vocab lists及flashcards, 動輒要花上事主數小時甚至數天時間去完成, 事主逼不得已犧牲溫習其他科目的寶貴時間, 更拖垮了其他科目的成績, 最終換來的只有一個B, 英語能力卻不見得有任何改善<br /><br />而更可笑的是, VERP聲稱是一個自主學習的過程 (見pdf檔Objectives部分), 既然是一個自主學習的過程, 又何必在LANG2010中佔15% course grade呢?<br /><br />再者, LANG本來的目的是輔助主修科目的學習, 按道理LANG的workload不應比主修科目大, 然而LANG2010的workload相對主修科目而言, 可謂有過之而無不及, 實有喧賓奪主之嫌, 而VERP對主修科目的學習更是成事不足, 敗事有餘<br /><br />可見VERP名義上是個 “自主學習vocab, 提升英語水平” 的Project, 本質上是種借刀殺人, 浪費事主的時間來拖累其他科目的學習進度和成績, 繼而謀殺事主GPA的行兇手法<br /><br />據事主觀察, VERP這種行兇手法現時似乎沒有再出現, 但事主不知道VERP到底是被爛grade集團LANG Center完全 &quot;撤回&quot;, 還是已成 &quot;明日黃花&quot; 並 &quot;自然死亡&quot;, 抑或只是被 &quot;暫緩&quot; / &quot;押後&quot; / &quot;擱置&quot;, VERP的下落仍是未知之數, 只要爛grade集團LANG Center一天還沒有 &quot;壽終正寢&quot;, VERP還是會有借屍還魂的可能性, 請各位後人引以為戒<br /><br />可以肯定的是, LANG2010在事主心中如夢魘揮之不去",

Best way to avoid plagiarism is to use the skill of converting difficult science facts into easy messages, aka, use easier words in your speech and report. For the report do use synonyms if you cannot find any other way to explain the stuff.<br /><br />I got A from him at the end, I got full marks in the first two assignments and close to full range in the last 2.",

I can see her passion and experience in teaching language courses. In spite of her tight schedule (she has 10 lessons per week), every time she is well prepared for the lesson. <br /><br />Yet, I found the instructions of assignments unclear. Although there is a &quot;detailed&quot; marking scheme for every assignment, they are just &quot;cliche&quot; giving us meaningless information. We have to guess what the instructor wants by listening to his/ her explanations and asking for some follow-up clarifications. At the end of the day, it is the instructor himself/ herself who sets the marking criteria and gives out the scores. <br /><br />Another thing that makes no sense is the samples provided. Sometimes, I realized that our own performance is better than that of the sample(s) provided.

      "comment_content": "Trash.<br /><br />Although this course is called &quot;English for Science&quot;, ironically, chances are your instructor will not even have a science background or even care about science at all. As a result, the objectives of the course are really vague. While it seems like that the main theme of the course is to teach you how to communicate with the general public about science, you&#039;re asked to write something in a more technical setting, but you would get criticized if you write something too technical that the instructor cannot understand (WTF?). And honestly I don&#039;t see the point of the course, I had taken like some 10 years of English classes just to learn how to communicate with the general public, I don&#039;t need another course to teach me the same thing just on a different setting. I was expecting the content of the course to be something more intellectual, like how to communicate with other experts as a SCIENTIST, but not how to tell good science story to a random person on the street, like the course instructor. <br /><br />Honestly, I have learnt nothing from the course. The whole course design is so centered on the final group project. So instead of trying to improve your writing and presentation skills, the focus of its content is literally on how to score high on the assessments. So I paid my $42,100 to get educated, and now you&#039;re saying that I have to take a course just for the sake of passing it? What a waste of time.<br /><br />Occasionally, there would be lessons trying to teach you some writing skill, but they are in general lacking in depth and are really of no uses. Though the course won&#039;t bother to really try to improve your English, your &quot;performance&quot; and grade in the course are solely assessed based on your English proficiency. C&#039;mon UST, I already have my secondary school exams, LANG1002 and LANG1003 to tell me how bad I&#039;m in English; I really don&#039;t need another course to tell me that again. It is ENOUGH.",
      "comment_teaching": "Colin is a nice guy. At least he doesn&#039;t run the class in a secondary school style, which many local instructors loved to, and make the classroom has a somewhat relaxed atmosphere.<br /><br />Beware though, he seems to have really high standards and very strict grading (please see &quot;grading&quot;).",
      "comment_grading": "From my impression, the grading of LANG2010 is even worse than LANG1002, LANG1003.<br /><br />I had unfortunately had a killer instructor back in LANG1002, but I still managed to get a B+ at the end, and I had gotten a A- for LANG1003. But I only got a B for this course, even though I had spend almost 3 times as much effort on it as compared to 1002 and 1003.<br /><br />The grading has zero transparency. I still have no idea exactly what scores I got for the assessments.<br /><br />Only the score for the first writing task is released. And I scored quite poorly on that one (4&#039;s and 5&#039;s) because I didn&#039;t follow strictly on the &quot;suggested structure&quot; of the assessment, even though I have addressed all the different parts of the task. The grading is unexpectedly strict; literally every single spelling mistake counts (I had been criticized for a typo). I guess there is again that &quot;impressionism&quot; thing in the grading of all these LANG course. If you scored low on one of the grading criteria, chances are you would score bad on all of them, unless you are really good. Be sure to triple check with the rubric before submitting.",
      "comment_workload": "Quite a lot.<br /><br />You had to submit two vocabulary lists on week4 and week 11. The vocab lists are really useless but extremely time-consuming. Then on week 7 you need to make a 5-min presentation about how that vocab list shit helped you learn new vocab (Ikr, wtf.)<br /><br />Then there is a individual writing task, a group presentation and a group writing task.<br /><br />The individual is only about 500 words, but it is due in some of your busiest days during the midterm period.<br /><br />The group project would take you quite a lot of time to prepare and complete, unless you are really good in English. I myself had spent almost the whole last three weeks in the semester doing nothing but this shit.<br /><br />But the sad truth is, your effort is not proportional to your grade. The more time you need to put on your project, the more likely you are will receive a bad grade at the end...because the whole point of the course is to remind you how bad is your English.",

It teaches students how to present innovative scientific or engineering ideas and write those in an academic way. This session helps a lot in presentation skills but a little in writing.

      "comment_teaching": "In early and most classes, she will discuss and guide you through several science fictions in different topics, which could be a boring and meaningless process. Also, she may requires students to come on time and do the homework for discussion.

Those are easy to follow while any missing will seriously lower you grade of the report. <br />Secondly, the instructor is said to be a killer, giving some Ds in lang 100X (dunno which course, either 1002 or 1003). She said she followed the marking scheme as always. To be fair, she gave a 4 or 5 on average for your assessment. Though I had a few mistakes making me score a 3 in some parts, I still managed to get 7 and 6 in the last report and i get an A-, which, in my opinion, is fair. Generally, she also gave quite high marks to the others. Therefore, I will say show her how hard you work.<br />Thirdly, this course is to a certain extent about group work so make sure you get some responsible group mates.",
      "comment_workload": "To have a good grade, basically, you need to at least secure the participation mark and vocabulary tests which are quite easy. Just try to answer some of her question.
