      "comment_teaching": "The instructor tries to enhance class atmosphere by doing discussions often, making jokes. But she does not convey assessment criteria clearly and explicitly. During discussions, low quality essays were used and she agrees with every point the students make, while for the actual assignments she has her own expectations. <br /><br />Assignment submission methods are very tedious and troublesome. As a result, she spent a long time to explain so, which is a waste of lesson time.",
      "comment_grading": "Super harsh<br /><br />You get middle/ middle high grades for all assignments, but then you will end up with a C+ / C. <br /><br />Assignment criteria was not clearly set before the submission, and you were informed of not fulfilling this and that after you get the result. Then a new set of criteria comes for the next assignments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Terrible workload with bad grades as well!",
      "comment_workload": "Huge workload.<br /><br />(1) During post COVID years, putting presentations on ZOOM which is prone to internet problems is ridiculous, even if this is a course in digital media.<br />(2) Group project is about doing an ACTUAL charity service, and then promoting the activity in ZOOM as a group. The whole thing is deviated from the course outcomes and makes people stressed when they couldn&#039;t hold a charity event due to problems in finding organizers, participants or materials. <br /><br />(3) Reflection essay is meaningless as whether the instructor agress with what you said you have learnt is subjective.",
