So, do prepare yourself and grasp the opportunity in class. <br /><br />For the second speaking task, remember to attend the consultation! She will give you precise advice. Just follow her advice and you will get satisfactory marks. I remembered just four of us attended that consultation :(<br /><br />As for the vocab list, remember not to skip any of the words or duplicate the words lolll cuz she said she could notice them. <br /><br />Remember to keep the speeches creative!! especially for the second speaking task so that you can stand out!",

I&#039;m the kind of introverted person, so I feel hard to share my ideas in classes even I prepared them for a long time. But Graham gives everyone opportunities to speak out. I hope I can be his student for this term too, LOL.<br />What I rly what to say is, he gave useful feedback, which was very important for an English class.

      "comment_content": "The curriculum of A class has not been updated as it has been in S and I classes. This is a task-based course in which all the lectures would guide you through your assessed tasks. The course aims to enhance your writing and speaking abilities. The content is pretty boring to be honest, but it gives you some good insights and strategies on giving speeches and academic writing. Attendance is taken but it is not counted towards your final grade, but Fiona said the school office would call you if you skipped lessons.<br /><br />There are two units and an elective you must complete:<br /><br />Unit 1, People, Passion Possibilities (Focused on Speaking)<br /><br />Unit 2, Game Changers (Focused on Writing)<br /><br />Elective, Research and Referencing Skills (Focused on citation skill)",
      "comment_teaching": "Fiona is friendly and cheerful. She often uses her own stories and experience to explain the course’s content so as to make it less boring. Fiona likes her classes to be interactive, so she often asks students to answer questions or give short sharing randomly. She also likes dividing students into groups to discuss. Don’t worry if you are quiet and shy like me who hardly talked in class, there’s no participation score, but active participation would surely leave a better impression on her.",

Don’t do them sloppily or else you would get a bad grade. The library quiz doesn’t affect your grade though. <br />My grade: (4/4)<br /><br />Writing Task (30%): The main dish, write a 600-800 words essay exploring a past game changer. You must follow the directions given during lessons.<br />My grade: (18+1/21) *1 bonus point for correct citation<br /><br />Speaking Task 2 (20%): 4-min presentation given in front of the class about your chosen game changer. Practice it thoroughly and don’t rely on cue cards if you can, most of my classmates and I could give our speeches confidently without them. <br />My grade: (20/21)<br /><br />Vocabulary Record (20%): Complete 3 vocabulary records, 40 provided words for each record, give definitions and sample sentences. Don’t copy directly from dictionary if you want better grade. <br />My grade: (4/4)<br /><br />My result: A+<br />Getting A-range isn’t difficult if you can follow all the instructions given and spend time refining your work.",

      "comment_content": "LANG1002 is a task-based, integrated-skills, English language course developed for first year students. It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.<br />The course is graded and carries three credits.<br /><br />*Honestly, no one can be &#039;more proficient&#039; in English by just taking a lang course in just one semester. The only useful thing is the format of citation, which is included as a part of the course.",

Maybe UST students are too stressed and are always tired. From my observation, my lang-mates love to recharge a bit in his lessons. <br /><br />Ah! Also, you may want to consider Bruce if you&#039;re not a talkative person. You may also want to consider him if you don&#039;t want to meet a lot of new friends from LANG classes. Basically, I don&#039;t need to talk or do any sorts of discussions or interactions in his lessons. So, yup, you know what I mean.",

Although attendance does not count towards the final grade (the attendance component that he posts on canvas is fake), you can make new friends in class :)<br /><br />- the classes are not very useful. When he talks about things that are not so useful, you can pretend to be listening but instead be daydreaming in ur head :)<br /><br />- the library quiz on citing sources and the bunch of &quot;imported assignments&quot; in canvas (e.g. practice citing sources in APA style...) are useless. You just have to finish them, the correctness doesn&#039;t matter. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can blindly guess the ans, which is exactly what I did, didn&#039;t even bother to read the questions before choosing the answer.<br /><br />- Treat vocab records seriously. For &quot;what I have learnt&quot;part, try to choose at least two aspects among &quot;synonyms, antonyms, collocations, formality...&quot;<br /><br />- For the first and second speaking tasks, try memorizing the script. You should not seem to be reading from the script, which is super unnatural. Record yourself and practice a few times beforehand to make sure the whole speech is smooth, natural, and not too exaggerated.<br /><br />- For the essay writing process, try to make the proposal as detailed as possible to make him think that you are well-prepared. Also, when he meets with you, ask him for recommendations (structure, opening, ending) to make your essay better. Keep asking him for his preferences and requirements as much as possible and follow them when you are writing the final essay.<br /><br />- For the essay, remember to use wt he taught in class. (hedging, more noun clauses, longer sentences...). And follow his preferences. For the reference list, remember to arrange the author names in Alphabetical order (which he didn&#039;t teach in class and all of us lost the bonus mark)<br /><br />- He is a nice guy. Try to ask him for his preferences for each and every assessment (speaking, essay, vocab...) and follow them, then you will get a good grade. Ask him in class or after class because he doesn&#039;t usually reply to emails.",

Also, for the essay writing, we have to quote different sources and we have to make in-text citation using APA style. He did teach us the format of APA style and introduces a very useful website in making in-text citation which you can directly copy it in your essay.

I think these tasks have their values but for the vocabulary records, they are just useless and I spend the most in doing these rubbish vocab records. I almost spent a week in each vocab record and you have to do 40 vocabs each time. So leave more time for vocab records.",

Minimum 40 words and maximum 50 each, one sample sentence, word forms and synonyms/antonyms for every word. The rule is really simple: the higher your effort, the higher your grade.

Next term you will take LANG1003 which is an extension of this course. Do you really want to do all of this when you can get 6 easy credits by transferring?<br /><br />Well you may also learn APA citation from the library section but come on, you can just find APA citation generators online.",

      "comment_workload": "[Here is the guide on credit transfer]<br />I only have a 5 in DSE English but managed to score a 7.5 in IELTS.<br />So here are the steps:<br />1. Visit https://crtran.ust.hk/exam_redirect<br />2. Check the requirements of credit transfer. Here I use IELTS for example: Grade of score needed for credit transfer is 7.0 or above (with no subscore lower than 6.5) and also the footnote declares that &quot;To be valid for credit transfer, a grade or score must have been obtained in the two<br />years before a student applied for admission to HKUST, i.e. if the student’s application is<br />dated 1st March 2019, the grade or score must have been obtained in the period 1st March 2017-1st March 2019.&quot;<br />3. Follow https://crtran.ust.hk/application_procedure but do not use the &quot;Credit Transfer System for Undergraduate Students&quot; (https://w5.ab.ust.hk/jsct/ct_stdt_appl) because you will not find public examinations like IELTS there, only university names as this system is for people who have studied in other universities before. However, you should take note of &quot;Official transcript or examination certificate&quot; and &quot;Course/subject information&quot; (LANG1002 and LANG1003).<br />4. Send an email to crtran@ust.hk and remember to attach a copy of your IELTS results.<br />5. Within a few days you should notice that your registered courses (Navigate to https://my.ust.hk/ -&gt; click &quot;Student Center&quot; -&gt; click &quot;enrollment shopping cart&quot; -&gt; scroll to the bottom) will have a dropped LANG1002 course. This is completely normal and signifies that your application is being processed.<br />6. Remember to register a Common Core course to substitute for the dropped LANG course! Most Year 1 Fall students have a 14 credit load and you will probably want to live an easier Year 2 Fall and afterwards with a lower credit load then 15. I chose PHYS1111 since I had a 5 in DSE Physics and fortunately a 2 in M2 so that I don&#039;t have to compete with NDS in MATH1013 and PHYS1112.<br />7. Within a few more days you will receive an email from crtran@ust.hk, e.g.<br /><br />Dear student,<br />You could now check your SIS system for credit transfer result. Thank you.<br />Best Regards,<br />Kayla LAM<br />Academic Registry<br /><br />8. Verify that your Credit Transfer report (Navigate to https://my.ust.hk/ -&gt; click &quot;Student Center&quot; -&gt; click &quot;My Academics&quot; -&gt; click &quot;View my transfer credit report&quot;) has 6 credits successfully transferred. (See attachment SuccessfulTransfer.png)<br />9. In addition to submitting the official documents by email, you must also bring them to the HKUST Academic Registry to have them scanned. To remind you, you will receive an email:<br /><br />Dear student,<br /><br />You may wish to note that we have processed your credit transfer based on the transcript/certificate provided by you via email or uploaded to the credit transfer system (for credit transfer with institution courses).<br /><br />Please be reminded to present the official transcript/certificate to the Academic Registry (Room 1381, 1/F, Lift 17-18) for our verification by the end of November 2020. Please refer to our webpage (https://arr.ust.hk/reg/index.html) for the opening hours.<br /><br />Should you have any difficulty in presenting the official documents by the specified deadline, please do not hesitate to contact us (email: crtran@ust.hk).<br /><br />Academic Registry<br /><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;+852 3469 2213&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F:&nbsp;&nbsp;+852 2358 0769<br />E:&nbsp;&nbsp;crtran@ust.hk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W:&nbsp;&nbsp;https://crtran.ust.hk",

      "comment_content": "Content is just meh. <br />Don&#039;t blame the Prof though because it&#039;s the same throughout the entire cohort. Very easy to understand but just extremely boring.<br />One thing to note about this course is that it is a cookie cutter kind of course, which doesn&#039;t teach you the beauty of English (cliche and gross but its true). You are not given the flexibility argue on the validity of your answer. For instance: during the vocabulary test, if your answer makes sense and even if the prof agrees, you can&#039;t do shit because it&#039;s not the answer written on the answer manual. This defeats the purpose of learning and caused me huge frustration.",

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfil the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence – e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically – necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education.<br /><br />In this course, you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course project will help you to develop these further.<br /><br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />1.write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />2. use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />3. extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

      "comment_content": "The content of this course revolves around the four graded tasks.<br /><br />The first of them is a self-recorded speech to inspire possibility in younger students. The course starts off by discussing the meaning of &quot;passion&quot;, then moves on to various literacy skills such as paraphrasing and story-telling.<br /><br />The second and third are both written tasks and are closely related: a single paragraph about a past game-changing idea, and an expository essay on the same topic, respectively. A library workshop that teaches you how to cite sources is hosted at this stage. Even if you don&#039;t care about participation marks, I highly recommend you attend it to avoid plagiarism in your work.<br /><br />The fourth task is a talk about your past game-changer which is presented in front of the class. Basically, all you have to do is convert your essay into a speech. Easier said than done. Fortunately, this course introduces many techniques that help engage your audience during your talk.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that there is a textbook designed for this course that is mandatory to have? It covers pretty much all of the content used for this course, so make sure you have it as soon as the course starts!",

An average of 4 marks per aspect is required to pass the course.<br /><br />Do note that there is a minimum attendance requirement of 80%, so try to attend as many classes as possible.<br /><br />Grading is quite good, I really messed up on my first writing task (4+5) but still managed to get A+ with an overall score of 84.98%.",

There are three types of assignment, vocab tests, speaking assignments and writing assignments. We had two vocab tests, two speaking assignments and two writing assignments. Everything we had learned in and after class turned out to be very useful in those assignments.<br />Diligence and hard work will always pay off.

It is the first of two one-semester courses which students take in order to fulfill the Common Core English requirement. The course is designed to raise your language proficiency and equip you with the underlying competence - e.g. thinking critically, discussing and presenting ideas logically - necessary for you to succeed in English-medium study in tertiary education. <br /><br />In this course you will develop your ability to use English to communicate appropriately and effectively. The thematic focus of the course provides context for tasks, most of which require small group collaboration and discussion. They are central to the course methodology. The course materials have been designed to present you with in-class challenges to your present language proficiency and communication skills, and the course assessment will help you to develop these further. <br />Both research and experience have indicated that the major academic language needs of students are in the areas of writing, speaking, vocabulary and extensive reading. The specific emphasis of LANG1002 is, therefore, on increasing your ability to:<br /><br />write in a coherent, well-organised way;<br />speak fluently, clearly, and effectively in a variety of contexts;<br />use a range of complex language, where appropriate to the task;<br />extract key information quickly from written texts;<br />take charge of your own language learning, particularly with respect to increasing your vocabulary.",

One of the most important skills is nominalization, which is basically the technique of converting long clauses into noun phrases to make the sentence more compact.<br /><br />Another learning point is cohesion, which is basically what distinguishes an A-range essay from a B-range essay. Cohesion is related to whether our essay seems logically and literally smooth and fluent. Sometimes your essay is comprised of individual sentences which are structurally and grammatically correct, but just doesn&#039;t look smooth on the whole. If that&#039;s the case, most likely what your essay lacks is cohesion.<br /><br />For those who are always stuck at level 5 in writing should particularly work on the cohesion of your writing because most likely it is what bars you from getting a 6 or even a 7. Once you&#039;ve mastered how to make your essays coherent, you&#039;ll easily grab As in your other LANG and SOSC/HUMA essays afterward.",

There are many things to be aware of.

She would show the outstanding work from other students and told us what is good about it.

No final exam. <br /><br />There are 2 assessed speaking tasks, 2 writing tasks, and a vocab quiz. <br /><br />The first speaking task is about Inspiring Possibility. You are advised to include a story in a 3-minute speech. The speech is videotaped. <br />The second speaking task is 3.5 minutes. The topic is about a PAST game changer. <br /><br />The first writing task is a 200-word exploratory essay and needed to be done in class. You need to prepare an article related with a game changer that you chose. The second writing task follows the first task and had to complete a whole essay based on the paragraph that you wrote in the first task.<br /><br />For the vocab quiz, just complete the 120-word bank on VOLT. Complete the activities and games. Do some regular study and the quiz is not hard. Just fill in the blanks but beware of the word form.",

The course itself consists of generally 2 parts: Speaking and Writing. It aims to enhance your ability in these 2 aspects. For A stream students, they may find it familiar since many techniques taught in classes may have been studied by themselves before, such as use of anecdotes, intonation and delivery as well as academic writing. There are also optional reading materials which allow you to obtain more relevant information for the course. There are also numerous teaching videos which you can learn more about academic writing skills and persuasive speaking. You MUST buy a textbook for the course.",

It serves as a continuous speaking practice which ultimately aims to help us speak bravely and fluently. Melissa also excels in utilizing resources for her teaching. She always finds some videos and shows it in the lesson. She also encourages us to discuss. In almost every lesson, we are required to have some small-scale discussions and share our ideas. Melissa really pays effort to our assignments that she gives very detailed feedback. Anyway, all classes are held in friendly and relaxing way.",

No exam.<br /><br />For the speaking tasks, you need to <br />1. take a video for your own speech about university life<br />2. make a 4-minute speech in class about FUTURE game changer<br /><br />For the writing tasks, you need to<br />1. write an expository paragraph about a specific game changer<br />2. write a 5-paragraph academic essay introducing a PAST game changer and upload to Turnitin<br /><br />They cause very heavy workload as they are seemed. Managing your time well on finishing them is critical. Revising for vocab tests could also be torturing. <br /><br />REMINDER: DO NOT SKIP LESSONS! THE INSTRUCTOR TAKES ATTENDANCE EVERY CLASS!",

However, with my professor, homework&#039;s were not necessary and she left it up to us. This can make the workload quite less however most teachers do not do this.",

      "comment_content": "基本上佢都係跟書教，上堂有時會作下短文比佢睇，又或者教少少Grammar (無咩用)，同埋做下group discussion (都係吹吹水)，除左要交essay chur 同拍片chur d 之外，整體都叫輕鬆",
      "comment_teaching": "幾好，instructor 比較頹底，所以上堂大家輕輕鬆鬆當休息下，同埋都算幾nice，問野都幾樂意答你。之於教o既內容，其實就無咩學到野。",
      "comment_grading": "比grade 主要睇<br />1. vocab test<br />2. attendance (同堂有冇YO 佢，主動答問題之類)<br />3. Video presentation<br />4. essay<br /><br />整體有5 有6，拎B+，應該算Fair。",
      "comment_workload": "正如之前咁講，除左要交essay chur 同拍片chur d 之外，整體都叫輕鬆，vocab test 上堂前半個鐘背下解釋已經ok。",
