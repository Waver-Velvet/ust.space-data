This course focuses on training college students&#039; basic essay writing skills and academic speaking and discussion abilities by developing group speaking and writing tasks related to the latest global issues in technology, environment, social sciences, and other fields. I believe that the course places a moderate emphasis on English proficiency, with a greater emphasis on cultivating students&#039; ability to gather information for research. This is similar to the previous social issue component of the English Language subject in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) examinations and also responds to the need for university general education to cultivate students&#039; critical thinking skills and humanistic concerns.",

Her English pronunciation closely resembles that of native British speakers. She is capable of providing students with clear instructions to complete classroom tasks.

I have tried my best to follow her guidelines, including using the phrases recommended, and using strategies taught in lessons ... but it doesn&#039;t work!<br /><br />For ST2 and WT, I have only put in 3 hours for preparing each assessment, but ironically, my result is even better! (at least seeing &#039;Advanced&#039; finally) (Maybe because I try to impress her so she gives me an &#039;Advanced&#039;?)<br /><br />Conclusion: the grading is &#039;MOTHER F*CKER&#039;. Most normal students would get &#039;competent&#039; in ALL assessments. You should be thankful if your teacher gives you &#039;Advanced&#039;. It is fortunate for me to already have a major in year 1 so it won&#039;t cause a big problem with studying, but for most year 1 students without a major, this course is a NIGHTMARE and KILLER to students&#039; GPA.<br /><br />Edit after grade released:<br />I give grading D but not E because I can get B even I have only got &#039;Advanced&#039; for 1 time. According to previous reviews, I should get C/C+ with such performance. I think impression counts significantly on your grade, so your destiny mainly depends on your instructor?<br /><br />FYI LV.5 in both DSE 2023 Paper 2 (Writing) and Paper 4 (Speaking)",
      "comment_workload": "I would give D+.<br /><br />Usually you need to do some tasks or read some learning materials before attending the class. They take up some time to finish. If you really forget to do, it doesn&#039;t affect your studying.<br /><br />The workload is pretty high because each assessment and SDL takes much time to prepare, such as finding information on your chosen topics, using ChatGPT several times to complete tasks with comments on the work done by ChatGPT and preparing the speaking task in 2 weeks while taking away your precious time for studying mid-terms and final exams of other more useful courses.<br /><br />The only good news is that it is very easy to get full marks in SDL tasks, electives and reflective task, but it still takes you at least 30-40 minutes to finish each assignment. <br /><br />Studying tips:<br /><br />1. Do elective 3 since it is the only elective without having to seek an academic advisor&#039;s advice.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t spend over 4 hours preparing each assessment. From an economic perspective, the benefit of spending time on getting &#039;Advanced&#039; or above &gt;&gt; cost of getting &#039;Advanced&#039; or above. Don&#039;t put too much expectation on getting good grade in this course. Then you will feel better when receiving your scores.<br /><br />3. Actively participate in the lessons. Maybe you can get a better grade because the instructor would have a good impression on you?<br /><br />4. Citations in body paragraphs count in the word count.<br /><br />Good luck!",

      "comment_content": "Although the teaching skills of instructor is excellent, the policy is extremely inflexible.<br /><br />It forces you to use genAI in the course. It is extremely Inflexible for students who are unwilling to use Al. AI, especially genAI is an extremely controversial topic nowadays. Forcing students to use AI will let the environment of education become worse.<br /><br />There are also some homework which needs you to book an instructor. However, they won’t mention this earlier. Therefore, when the due date of the homework is near, it actually becomes a ‘disaster’ when I saw this information.(since the information is in the homework but not mentioned before.) The homework allows you to ask the instructor to give advice instead for an advisor. However, I wait for a few days and an instructor still doesn’t respond my email.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching skills of the instructor is excellent. The class is interesting. The instructor will train some junior instructor by giving them more experience too. However, the instructor never responds to the email from student which is an important thing to notice and improve.",
      "comment_grading": "Actually, there is nothing to complain about the grading, since it is easy for us to know where we can do better and where we did good by the gradings which is very important for a course and the student.",
      "comment_workload": "Although the number of homework is acceptable, the inflexibility of course policy greatly increases the workload. Therefore, it is important to improve the flexibility of the policy by not forcing students to use genAI, this will decrease the workload and make the education environment and the course become better.",
