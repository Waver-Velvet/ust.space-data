I do not think it is good for improving my English skill.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Refresh: Same as my thought before, althought the writing and speaking exam is not bad, I still do not think that it can improve my English skill. i.e. It does not have any good way to get the name of the course name:&quot;Intensive English Language for University Studies&quot;.",

So grading:C-&gt;D",
      "comment_workload": "The workload I think is not so many because there are only SDL and some elective homework. It is convenient for us to do some homework but actually, like I said before. It is very useless and I think we should be given more time in studying the knowledge of Science for students in Science Faculty.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Refresh: the requirement of the project is rigorous but the description of the essay is general. What I suggest, which is the most important, is that do not choose LANG1401 and LANG1402, better to tran them.",
