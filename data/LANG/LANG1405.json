The course will enable students to be: critical of current digital communication practices; reflective of their communication and participation through digital media; aware of how digital communication can impact language delivery; and reflective of their English language development. To achieve this, the course guides students in developing basic knowledge of digital literacy theories and practices and to produce their own digital media texts for English communicative purposes. Students will undertake authentic tasks related to their academic and future careers that enables them to achieve the necessary communication skills in a digital world.",

      "comment_teaching": "good teacher, because you dont feel that he is actually teaching you and you dont need to remember anything from his class, which also means you dont need to attend any classes to get good grade. No attendance required. <br /><br />You are requested to read the materials given each week before the class and you have to discuss these things during the start of the lectures with your groupmate (randomly sit every time).

(while the instructor of the other session is still Mark)<br /><br />One lesson per week (Blended Learning Mode); For some lessons, it became virtual because Sean is a busy person and he has to travel very often to attend conferences. <br /><br />Flow of each lesson:<br />1. Submit a poll response <br />2. Sean goes through the PowerPoints <br />3. Do in-class group activities and discussions<br /><br />Sean is an expert in the area of digital literacy and he explains the course content clearly and elaborated a lot with real-life examples. He is a very nice instructor and he is always willing to answer our questions about the course content and the assignment requirements. He encourages us to share our ideas in class but it is still fine if you don&#039;t know what to answer. When he knows that we are suffering from the mid term and final exam peaks, he is willing to extend the deadline of the assignments so we can have more time to finish them. For the main assignments, he gave us constructive feedback so we know how to improve in our next assignment.",

      "comment_workload": "I think the biggest workload would be the video podcast because I am not good at video editing. <br />Even if you know nothing about video editing, there is no need to panic because Sean told us he doesn&#039;t care too much about how the video is edited. As long as you tried to apply the theories and techniques taught in class into the video, then it will be fine enough. After that, please mention those theories in your rationale paragraph to let Sean know what techniques you have used.<br /><br />The second biggest workload is the online discussion forum. You will be assigned to a group and your group would need to have online discussions for six weeks (each person is responsible for leading the discussion for a week). The leader would have to think of a topic related to the course content and initiate discussions. The members would need to share their opinions and thoughts from time to time. <br /><br />For the online quizzes and meme assessment, I think the effort required is relatively low. Online quizzes are open-book ones and you have 1 attempt only. Unlimited time is allowed to finish it. You can just search for the answers of online quizzes in the course materials. As for the meme, you can utilise existing online meme and modify a bit according to your topic. <br /><br />Remarks: <br />- Not a must to do pre-class activities!!<br />- NO ATTENDANCE!!",
