The course discusses on some of the past engineering cases with ethical contradictions.

It also teaches you how to write a proposal for an innovative engineering idea.",

      "comment_teaching": "Can&#039;t say teaching is bad, it is just normal LANG lecturer. <br />Bruce is the course coordinator, he would teach using the powerpoint, putting screenshots on the powerpoint to teach. Quite boring tbh. Bruce really gave feedback on how to present after the first presentation, so I did better for the second presentation. (Multimodality: More than Good -&gt; Very Good)",
      "comment_grading": "The first day, I came in the classroom, found a empty seat to sit down. This lecturer came in the classroom and introduced himself. Sitting there, listening to his words, analysing whether this lecturer is a killer or a grade giver until I heard that he introduced himself as a course coordinator. So I was like, well, if he is the course coordinator, then his grades would not change much, how much effort I gave in would not be graded down, that&#039;s not too bad! <br />THIS IS THE MISTAKE I MADE, WHERE THE NIGHTMARE STARTED.<br />I know you dont care about my experience, let&#039;s jump to my grade. <br />I performed well in presentations, but according to his words, my grade &quot;overall grade has been greatly affected by both your writing 1 and writing 2&quot;. <br />For writing 1, this is an individual project, so I wrote the writing all by my own. <br />and for writing 2, it is a group project, we divide into different part for writing, my part is not long as I did a lot for the first presentation, I only have to write about 2 paragraphs. <br /><br />==============================================<br /><br />[Excellent, Very Good, Good, Satisfactory, Below Satisfactory, Poor, Very Poor]<br /><br />Writing 1:<br />Substance &amp; Synthesis: Satisfactory<br />Coherence: Below Satisfactory <br />Language: More than Satisfactory<br /><br />This is the part where triggered me to write this review. <br /><br />For substance &amp; Synthesis, I read the whole 30-page case report for hours, finding clues inside, highlighting them, putting them in a doc file, and trying to make them relevant. This process already cost me almost 10 hours. But well, I got satisfactory; I don&#039;t know how Bruce marked my work on this. Maybe he used the number of references to mark student&#039;s work? But I also had 6 reference materials used—not just 3 or 4 references each page, but almost 8–10 for a fully written page. Mmm... Interesting..<br /><br />For the Coherence part, the reason I got below satisfactory, is because I had used point form for matching the code ethics to the incident details, and divide the stakeholders one-by-one, I thought this would clearly show how they would match. And I saw no materials mentioning point-form is bad, I attended the lesson and Bruce emphasised we need to match the details to the code ethics one by one. However, after I got my grade, he said &quot;Point form is greatly discouraged; and the connectivity between causes/issues could have been more interrelated. It is now, as it stands, ideas were truncated.&quot; I guess, blame me, I didn&#039;t ask him whether this is okay or that is okay on lesson.<br /><br />For Language, this is the best part. I had not idea I would only got &quot;more than Satisfatory&quot;, Bruce spotted some &quot;mistakes&quot; which I see no mistakes at all, and I have kept using them for my DSE, for my CORE1402/CORE1403 courses, I didn&#039;t know they are mistakes until now. I can&#039;t say more, let&#039;s just give you some ideas:<br />(1) &quot;in lieu of a structural engineer&quot; should be &quot;instead of a structural engineer.&quot;<br />(2) &quot;it is proposed that regulation should be implemented&quot; should be &quot;it is proposed to implement regulations.&quot;<br />(3) &quot;Before the collapse, ...&quot; should be &quot;Prior to the collapse, ...&quot;<br /><br />I guess he is my leading light who could ameliorate my writing skills to another level. And, the essay is limited to 1000 words, I tried to reduce my word count during writing because I wrote too much.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Writing 2: <br />Substance &amp; Synthesis: Good<br />Coherence: More than Satisfactory<br />Language Use and Accuracy: More than Satisfactory<br /><br />I don&#039;t have much to say about writing 2, since it is a group project, make sure you communicate well with your groupmates for Coherence, as my groupmates are deadline fighters, would not show up until the deadline day midnight/ morning, I guess you should find a friend with you. <br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />One more thing: this lesson also taught me telepathy. <br />&quot;Detailed comments were provided to you on Canvas and now copied to the space below. Since the scores and comments were released on Oct 14 2023. No assignment review for Part 1 assessments would be accepted:&quot;<br />The moment I am writing this review, I still can&#039;t see any comments on Canvas. I also asked my classmates, yes, nothing. I guess the course coordinator couldn&#039;t use canvas well. <br /><br />P.S. All the presentation and report did not use GenAI<br /><br />Final letter grade: <br />C+<br />===============================================<br />FYI:<br />English Writing: 5<br />Core 1402: B<br />all writing, mostly got Competent/Advanced ~ Advanced<br />Core 1403S: A, <br />half writing half video, writing part got Competent/Advanced ~ Advanced/Exceptional (Language)",

Engineers and Creativity<br /><br />The 1st half would be focusing on engineer ethical issues, like &quot;cost vs. safety&quot; or &quot;should I listen to my boss&#039;s stupid opinion&quot; etc.<br />An engineer disaster case is assigned to each group, the case would be the topic of your analytical report and presentation. The task is to analyse the causes and ethical issues behind the disaster. Straight forward and not too difficult.<br /><br />The 2nd half is about innovation, where you need to find an existing technology, review it, find the niche, and create a new thing that can solve the niche. This part requires a lot of researching, so be thoughtful to choose which area you want to study.",

Two essays (pt.1: 900-1000w, pt.2 1000-1200w)<br />2. Two group presentations (14 mins for 3 people, 16 for 4 people)<br />3. Four practice tasks (3 short paragraph with range 100-150w, 1 mock presentation with 1 min for each person)<br />4. An 1-hour library workshop<br /><br />The major problem is, you will have only 1 week after the deadline of the essay if you are the first to present.

In this part you need to analyze related ethical issues and try to convince people that those ethical issues may seriously undermine the company. <br /><br />Then your group needs to come up with an engineering innovation e.g. a drone to deliver food, glasses to take note, language learning game etc. This part is fairly interesting and you need to walkthrough the whole process of how your innovation works.

I also thought throughly when writing the reports e.g. taking into account multiple perspectives and making sure all the key points are there. <br /><br />When instructor Bruce gave us comments after the first presentation, I have learnt my mistakes and corrected them in the second presentation. <br /><br />All these require huge amount of time and dedication, but in the end they slapped me with a <br /><br />Grade: B<br /><br />Why B? well I don&#039;t even know because this course has no transparency in terms of grading. They never release your report and presentation scores...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For reference, I got A+,A- in other non common core courses with similar effort, so think twice before you put in serious effort here...

      "comment_content": "To engineering students, LANG2030 is your school-specific English course you&#039;ll need to take. And as a result, the course contents are more engineering-oriented, though its style is still with the typical LANG courses you experienced in 1002/1003 - i.e., water-blowing skills:<br />Unit 0: Engineers and identity (Introduction)<br />Unit 1: Engineers and social responsibility<br />Unit 2: Engineers and creativity<br /><br />I have adequate reasons to believe that CLE compiled the course textbook without paying due regard to real-life engineering practicability. For example, an example in the textbook proposed using robots on horizontal rails to paint building exteriors. Sounds good? Another engineering student attending my session immediately stated the proposal suffered from serious structural integrity problem, and was in fact, chosen to be a negative example of engineering product in another course!",
      "comment_teaching": "To my experience, Ellen Yik (Ping Chui) did her effort to maintain satisfactory learning atmosphere in her lessons. She also tried to encourage participation, such as organizing ad hoc mini-presentations related to course contents. Unfortunately, due to clashes with holidays and some additional sick leaves by Ellen, our teaching time ends up being quite cramped.<br /><br />That said, as one will expect for a typical LANG course, the learning atmosphere is quite low. This is especially observable during f2f lessons. On one lesson, we were told to present something rather straightforward, such as doing presentations on junior-secondary English grammar in one lesson. While I do agree that those are common mistakes in writing, I simply don&#039;t think that presentation is the best way to practice this...",

Also for the invention presentation, you will lose mark if you hold script, so one may want to practice more on your presentation part.<br /><br />P.S.: the invention presentation consists of a Q&amp;A section, with other students and the instructor will ask question of your invention. However, given by the course&#039;s learning environment, it is best not to ask too difficult questions, as everyone were aiming for a easy pass...<br /><br />Ultimate grade: A-",
      "comment_workload": "When compared to previous LANG1002/1003 (which usually only have 1-2 smaller speaking assignments), this course has a larger focus on presentation. One should also note that LANG2030 is less guided than the previous LANG1002/1003: you need to take charge of your own writing/invention project. There&#039;re no sub-assignments to guide you in LANG2030.<br /><br />The individually submitted ethics essay and presentation require your group to work on a pre-determined engineering catastrophe, while the invention-related tasks require your group to &quot;design&quot; a invention and to promote it via an individually submitted proposal and a group presentation.<br /><br />Why I quoted the design? As a LANG course (see Content part), the instructors don&#039;t care much about the practicability of your proposal. I&#039;ve seen flying-taxis, underground logistics tubes, and much more inventions that looks best for pyramid/MLM fraudsters...<br /><br />Speaking of workload, I consider it&#039;s similar to LANG1002/1003, except this time you&#039;re working with your groupmates in group assignments. Before that you were scavenging information for your essay, now that you&#039;re scavenging information for your group essays and projects.",

The group project (essay and video presentation) in turn needs a lot more active participation out-of-class, but the &quot;group&quot; part may be a blessing or a curse depending on your groupmate&#039;s willingness to participate. <br />If you have groupmates that are active enough, the work should be well distributed and manageable.

Engineering ethics <br />Each group (3 students) is assigned with an engineering ethical case and work on an individual analytical report(700 words) and a group presentation (max 15 mins), investigating the causes and development of an engineering disaster, its relevant ethical issue and misconducts, and provide suggestions and recommendations. <br /><br />2. Engineering innovation <br />Propose an innovative engineering idea/technology with an individual report (1000-1200 words) and a group proposal presentation (15 mins), with Q&amp;A session during classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />During classes, the tutor would provide guidance on the language features for presenting the ideas in the report and the presentation.",

He would simply demonstrate to us. So no worry if you have doubts on how to present the writings.

My assigned topic is Tianjin Explosion, where you are provided with some background information and you can search some additional materials for the writing.

It is a (mostly, technically not) project-based course which students are divided into groups for two small projects. Both parts consist a writing assessment (individual) and a speaking assessment (group).<br /><br />The first part of the course is about analyzing ethical issues. Each group is given an ethical case to conduct a research. Causes and their ethical implications of the case have to be analysed. The individual writing and group presentation may share the same content.<br /><br />The second part of the course is about presenting an innovation. Each group have to come up with a new tech product and write up a proposal. Research has to be done to investigate the product&#039;s feasibility and the potential benefits.<br /><br />However, IMO the content is not that important. The good thing is you will meet some new friends deadline fighting with you for the projects. :)",

While she had 5 classes this semester, she still offered lots of consultation slots for us. She sent lots of email to remind you about the deadlines, and there are lots of supplementary info that helps you with your assignments. What&#039;s more, her speed in replying emails is insane! She will tell you when she can reply back even she is not free. lol <br /><br />She gave extremely detailed feedback on all the assignments. Her comments sometimes are even longer than our work! #adore# Although some of our work are done poorly, she did not discourage us. Instead, she put some focus on the thing we did well and gave constructive feedback to help us improve. <br /><br />She is a very kind-hearted tutor. For the part 2 assignments, most of us are distracted by the incident and were busy with other subjects. So, she got in touch with the coordinators and asked for deadline extension just for our class. (Extended by 2 days as a result.) I remember once my teammate did not prepare well for the consultation. She did not blame my teammate, and even held an additional consultation just for him! <br /><br />I am extremely impressed by how much effort Rosie had put in this course. She might not be the best tutor for English (don&#039;t get me wrong, she taught pretty good!) but definitely is the nicest tutor. Definitely recommended.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is not as bad as other reviews claimed. Rosie is also pretty lenient for grading the assignments. The grade quite depends on how the curve is adjusted among different classes and how your tutor grades you.

      "comment_workload": "The workload is a little bit more than an average course. Aside from the four standard writing and speaking assessments, we have to complete canvas writings and vocabulary tests. There may be additional out-of-class exercises from the course book (depends on tutor).<br /><br />Additionally, you have to reserve time for lots of project meetings. Most likely, you need to allocate one or two hours weekly for project meetings and consultations. A good communication among your group is quite essential in this course.<br /><br />Really glad to have a tutor that would extend the deadly deadlines.",

Some cases are provided and you have to work on 1 of the cases assigned by the tutor. Second is presenting the issue in groups of 3 to 4 in front of your classmates. <br /><br />Due to the presentation, you should be divided into groups prior to the essay task, and so your groupmates and you will be writing about the same case. Note that the case is the same but the content in your own essay may differ from theirs.<br /><br />As for the presentation, it will be 1-2 weeks after the submission of the essay. Only 1 slide per group member is allowed in THIS presentation, and our tutor emphasized the need for animation in the slide.<br /><br />Personally, it was so hard at that time as the presentation is within the midterm period.<br /><br />2. Proposal Report<br />In this part, 2 tasks are given. One is an individual proposal report of an innovation. The subsequent task is a presentation in groups of 3 to 4. <br /><br />Similarly, the idea in the report should be similar to the one to be presented, yet the details can differ from your groupmates (for example, some components/functions may be added/removed). The technology needed should be based on existing technology but the PRODUCT should be new. This is a difficult part for most of us (why don&#039;t companies just adopt our &quot;new&quot; ideas if ours are better?). So, our tutor suggested just adding some new components/functions on an existing product. In my opinion, if you really cannot think of a genuinely new product, make sure your tutor does not know about its existence. My idea was initially just a speed bump using non-Newtonian fluid, and the tutor originally did not know that and he approved that.",

If you are the one who studied LANG 1002S and LANG 1003A, you should have the experience that you can easily get an A in the A stream classes. <br /><br />I did really pay a lot of effort on the reports and I think I can secure an A- and possibly an A.<br />Finally, I really got A-, same as those who got some 5 and 6 in their assignments. <br /><br />Some data:<br />Part 1<br />Report: 6556<br />Presentation: 666<br />Part 2<br />Report: 7667<br />Presentation: 766<br /><br />Vocabulary test 1: 12/15<br />Vocabulary test 2: 13/15<br />Vocabulary test 3: 13/15<br />Participation: ?/5<br /><br />Total: 86% (assume participation 4 out of 5)<br /><br />One of my friends got some 5 and 6 and got A- as well.",
      "comment_workload": "Without final exams, the workload during the final exam period was greatly reduced.<br /><br />However, as mentioned, one presentation is in midterm exam period. Therefore, it may be hard for some people who have their presentation on the same day as other courses&#039; midterm exam(s). <br /><br />Also, if you want to secure an A- or B+, make sure you use different synonyms in your essays and sentence structures (eg inversion, conditional sentences, etc). You may want to have a list to see what types of sentence structures you have not yet utilized. Besides, coherence is a big issue. Critically judge on your work. You may let your tutor take a glance on it first. <br /><br /><br />As for the presentations, I heard that some tutors did not allow any cue cards. Don&#039;t worry with that in Yuen&#039;s classes. Some of us just printed the whole script out or brought a mobile during presentations. Just make sure you don&#039;t rely on it or you would get at most 4 in communication skills.",
