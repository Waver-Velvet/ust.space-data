    "description": "This course will help students appreciate the power of the sociological imagination in understanding their everyday lives. This is an age in which we tend to explain human behavior in terms of our individual achievements, personalities, and even our genetic make-up. The sociologist, however, looks at human behavior as the product of groups, organizations and culture. In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics.",

      "comment_content": "The course primarily revolves around the exploration of numerous German sociologists, which, to be honest, can be rather monotonous. A significant challenge lies in the necessity to memorize a plethora of names to perform well in the quizzes. The assessments, particularly the multiple-choice quizzes, demand rapid recall within a limited timeframe of 20 minutes. Given that these quizzes collectively contribute to 20% of the overall grade, each question holds substantial weight, making efficient recall crucial for success.<br /><br />The final examination introduces a different format, adopting an essay-style approach. Students are confronted with four questions, and they must select two to craft comprehensive essays. This requires not only a profound understanding of the various sociologists discussed throughout the course but also the ability to apply this knowledge cohesively in a written format. The comprehensive nature of the final exam, encompassing a broader synthesis of the course material, adds a layer of complexity and depth to the evaluation process.",
      "comment_teaching": "The quality of instruction in this course unfortunately falls below expectations. The considerable size of the class compounds the challenges, making it notably difficult to maintain focus and engagement. The professor&#039;s reliance on reading directly from the slides further contributes to the overall dissatisfaction with the teaching approach.<br /><br />Additionally, there is a unique attendance policy in place. While attendance is a requirement for earning points, it adds a layer of complexity as the professor selectively designates specific classes for attendance tracking. To secure the maximum attendance points, students are compelled to attend these selected classes. The stipulation of needing five attendances to accumulate all possible points creates a dynamic where not only the learning experience but also strategic attendance planning becomes essential for optimal academic performance. This intricate attendance structure introduces an additional layer of challenge to an already demanding academic setting.",

You can attend classes and do other stuff while waiting for the random (very easy) class participation.<br /><br />There are no assignments and you can study a day before the quizzes as they are very straightforward (try to memorise the names of the people who wrote each theory)<br /><br />The final is closed book and you need to write two essays which I thought would be tough as there is a lot of stuff to memorise. However, she told us she would give us 4-5 questions and we would have to choose 2. Since there are only 6 topics in total, you can just study about 3 and get away with it (which is what I ended up doing). <br /><br />For me this deserves an A because I don&#039;t think studying for final exam counts as real workload as its expected for all courses.",

Before every quiz, you can attend a zoom session to raise your concerns. After the online quiz, you can check your own paper on zoom with the TA in 5 mins. <br /><br />The videos are sometimes boring because of the flat tone. In general, the videos can well deliver the ideas and concepts to students.",

So I am satisfactory with the grading. <br /><br />The quizzes are not difficult if you go through the reading material and powerpoint slide. Pay EXTRA ATTENTION on the questions professor give on the reading material. ( They would appear in quiz or final) <br /><br />Usually the question would test your understanding of concepts. Professor like giving examples to you and ask which examples best illustrate certain concepts. Of course, there would may be 1 or 2 questions require some memorisation. But all in all, if you are willing to watch the lecture video and read the material, I am sure you would be fine.",

In the lectures, she was just kind of reading aloud the word file in front of the slides. <br /><br />She was not managing the time allocation well too, like why spending time discussing so many stuffs beyond the lecture contents. I mean, it is really ok and thought-provoking for a lecture, but it should not be too long and too far beyond the syllabus.<br /><br />I tried to attend the lectures but later I gave up. Read the notes would do. Create examples for your own convenience would do. Anything would do but attending lectures.<br /><br />Disclaimer 1: just opinion given according to my preferences and learning style. It may not suit you. I advise you to try attending the lectures in the first few weeks after all.<br /><br />Disclaimer 2: Note to non-local students - prof would play videos of local TV programme archives and use local examples to explain the social issues.

So you can write something you are interested in, rather than forced to write something. I think this helps lower the burden. At least I find it fun to write something I’m interested in.

      "comment_teaching": "可能係因為係鬼佬Professor， 佢上堂都算係風趣幽默，又有純正嘅英國口音，所以上堂都唔會太悶。其實佢都幾好人嘅，每堂都有好多時間畀大家問問題同一齊討論，又好Approachable。",
