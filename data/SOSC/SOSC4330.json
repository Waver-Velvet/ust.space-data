    "description": "Designed for students with prior knowledge in statistics and linear regression, this advanced course covers a wide variety of generalized linear models for categorical dependent variables that are commonly used in social science research, as well as such alternatives as quantile regression and robust regression. It also introduces selected models for complex data structures, including multilevel analysis, time-series analysis, and survival analysis. This course will address such model specifications as random- and fixed-effects and other topics. The course will be application oriented with special attention paid to estimation of the aforementioned models using social science datasets.",

If all the other team members agree that they don’t want to keep collaborating with one person, please comply the following rules to split the team: 1. each group member need to send an email to TA to justify their request. 2. the peer evaluation (10% of total score) will not be split. 3. the student who leaves the group must find a new proposal &amp; presentation topic<br /><br />當你開始做proj再report已經太遲 final period忙到閪咁已經冇心力屌柒班freerider<br />唯有自己做曬 g9g",

Final Presentation<br /><br />It might sound difficult, but it is really not. I did not know any of them before taking the class and still did well. <br /><br />You don&#039;t even need to actually understand all of them. You just need to understand and apply one of these methods in your final paper to get a good grade, even if you have absolutely no idea what the other methods are about. There is no mid-term or final exam to test your knowledge in everything.<br /><br />The coding part is in R, but since there is a pre-requisite everyone knows about the language already (hopefully).",

I know absolutely nothing about what is my grade on each task.",
      "comment_workload": "Actually not light, the assignments are challenging, and the mid-term paper and presentation require us to read some academic papers and provide some critics.<br /><br />The final paper is a 30 page paper with 1.25 spacing. I wrote more than 10,000 words for the final paper since I carried the group.<br /><br />Maybe the workload would be less if the workload is spread evenly across the group, but then you need to make sure the quality is up to standard.<br /><br />Not crazily challenging, but definitely worth the 4000-level workload, do not expect it to be some easy introductory course unless you are the one being carried.",
