    "description": "This course allows students to gain an understanding of the workings of the mind in the context of the technological advances that are increasingly shaping our lives and our society. The course introduces students to the domain, goals and methods of Cognitive Science, showing how different disciplines converge in their enquiry into how the brain works. Lectures will present case studies highlighting research findings which show how similar questions about the functioning of the human mind are answered from the perspective of each contributing discipline. Assessment: 100% coursework. (Students with fundamental computer science/linguistics/philosophy/neuroscience knowledge may take this course with waiver.)",
