      "comment_grading": "No comments on the grading. See the others for the statistics.<br /><br />Midterm is 70 MCs in approximately one hour, and you will be tested on the mini-assignment contents as well.<br />Final is 86 MCs + 14 marks short question + 20 marks essay.<br />MCs include mini-assignment contents as well, and the 20 marks essay is based on the two movies (1 question for each movie and only need to choose one question to answer).<br />You also need to remember statistics from mini-assignments and lectures (e.g. US, China, HK GDP).",
      "comment_workload": "Workload depends on whether you will do the assignments seriously.<br />There are one (regular) assignment (textbook questions/questions related to movie) and one mini-assignment (questions related to extra reading: can be book chapter, newspaper article or HK statistics/textbook questions) every week. Regular assignments are released on Thursday and due on next Tuesday, and mini-assignments are released on Tuesday and due on Thursday (so only 2 days time).<br />You can get full points for submitting anything for the assignments so there is little workload if you just want a pass. But since the contents in the mini-assignments will be examined, and doing the regular assignments can help you clear your concepts, you will eventually need to finish basically every assignment + mini-assignment if you want to do well in the exams, which will lead to a quite heavy workload.",
