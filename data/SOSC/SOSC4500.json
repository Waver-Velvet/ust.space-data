    "name": "The Politics of the State",
    "description": "This course introduces to senior undergraduate and first year graduate students in the Division of Social Science major topics in the study of the state in political science and sociology. It covers normative studies of the legitimacy and autonomy of the state, comparative historical analysis on state formation, empirical studies of state capacity, and nationalism. It incorporates both classical scholarship in the study of the state and recent progress in quantitative and qualitative research of the state. Readings are selected from political philosophy, historical sociology, political science and economic history. This course is designed to help the students to integrate quantitative and qualitative methodology in studying topics that are related to the state of their own interests. The course aims to help the students generate research ideas that are related to various aspects of the state in either contemporary or historical context, either China-focused or examining China in comparative perspective.",

      "comment_content": "This course is quite unique and not the typical one-size-fits-all SOSC course, so I tried by best to recall my memory and write some details in reviewing this course.<br /><br />This is a new course that Prof. He had on his mind for a while. This course is essentially a research-oriented political science course; while it incorporates many disciplines such as historical sociology, political philosophy and political economy into the discussion of the state, it covers lots of classical and important theories in state politics, from the empirical theories of Charles Tilly state formation (&quot;War made the state, and the state made war&quot;) and covers with the examples of the fiscal system in Qing and Britain to normative or qualitative theories of the organic state, Weber&#039;s legitimacy and so on, it introduces students to some of the essential topics and theories in state politics, i.e. the theoretical framework of the state, state formation, state capacity and state-society relationships. <br /><br />What makes this course unique is it showed the importance of the field of state and the huge research potential within this field, demonstrates how the existing theories are being challenged and evolved into contemporary and more complete theories, e.g. Weber&#039;s theory of legitimacy was being reviewed and suggested as a residue concept rather than a panacea for the explanation. Yet, as this course is research-oriented, many of the topics discussed do not have an answer; it left room for students and scholars to discuss, and students might find their research interests and develop their ideas in it. <br /><br />The topics are subjected to refinement and depend on how far the progress goes. For this semester, it covers:<br />Week 1 What is the State?<br />Week 2 The Concept of Organic State<br />Week 3 State Formation <br />Week 4 Infrastructural Power of the State<br />Week 5 Bureaucracy and State Power<br />Week 6 Modern Fiscal State<br />Week 7 Ideological Foundation of Qing Fiscal System<br />Week 8: Rise and Fall of Imperial China<br />Week 9 State Capacity and the Modern State<br />Week 10 The State Autonomy<br />Week 11 Legitimacy of the State<br />Week 12 Legitimation and Participation<br />Optional lecture(last lecture): Passive Rights and the Political Great Divergence",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. He&#039;s teaching is definitely one of a kind in the social sciences division at HKUST. He actively encourages students to think about each topic, explaining some of the very abstract but important theories patiently and in a comprehendible way, and eventually helps students brainstorm some interesting questions and help students develop their research ideas or questions throughout the course, this experience would be beneficial to students if they want to pursue further studies.<br /><br />Also, he would respond to emails pretty quickly and sometimes with feedback if you have made a few mistakes in your work; if students choose to work with a research paper for the course, he would provide some feedback on the topics and eventually provide some good reference paper to read, which is kind of unique for undergraduate courses.<br /><br />The TA is like a student in this class, learning and participating(or sharing his knowledge or thoughts) in this class; the only difference is he does not need to do assignments and grading students&#039; responses on whether there are obvious flaws or not.<br /><br />This is a seminar-like course; sometimes, the TA or even the PhD students will deliver a presentation of the lecture.",
      "comment_grading": "In short, the grading is good.<br /><br />The grading might not matter the most if you are taking this research-oriented course. Yet, talking about the grading, one thing that should not be overlooked is that only a few undergraduates are enrolling on this course since it does not help fulfil any major and minor requirements; out of 33 enrolled students this semester, only 6 or 7 students are undergraduates and several MPhil/PhD students are taking this course. Hence, I think the grading is purely based on your performance rather than the curve(which I think it&#039;s better).<br /><br />The grading is composed of participation(10%), three response papers(10% each)(you can write more if you aren&#039;t satisfied with your grade) and a final paper(60%) (either you wrote the topic given by the professor or you came up with your own research topic), the logic of grading on response paper is simple: as long as you do not make logical flaws or referencing errors in your responses, your marks would not be deducted since they were open-ended questions. For the final/ research paper, I think this rubric sticks the same, but you should be aware of making your own arguments rather than just analyzing or summarising the facts.<br /><br />For your reference, I participated a lot in class; I missed about a quarter of lectures, three of my written response grades are A, the grade of the final paper is not revealed, and my letter grade is A.",
      "comment_workload": "This is essentially a 4000-level course for senior undergraduates and first-year graduate students; it is not fair to apply the normal standard of workload here.<br /><br />The workload of this course can be very minimal or tremendous, depending on how much effort you put into it. If you do not choose to read the readings, then the workload would just be three double pages of responses and a final paper of 8-10 pages (or 14 pages and a proposal if you choose to write a research paper). However, the readings would be a bit overwhelming as there are over 80 pages of readings per week (usually three chapters of a book or with some highly cited/important academic papers); it would be impossible to read all the readings if you have lots of other workloads.<br /><br />Yet, if you do not read the readings entirely, you will find it very hard to understand and follow the discussion in class, so as the professor suggested, read the required readings in class (a chapter or usually 20-30 pages), and I guess that would help. <br /><br />I chose to write the research paper, so I would share a bit about my experiences, usually the process of coming up with a topic that is the most difficult. Yet, my approach is to combine some knowledge and background that I have known and try to incorporate it into the topics of state since it would be hard to propose something completely original with just a few weeks of study on the state. You might have thought about some unique lenses in the state, or you can start with the readings and go from there, and you would want to minimize your topics as narrow or specific as possible. Take some time to gather your evidence and form your arguments, and do proofreading after writing, and then the main task of this course is done; usually, it won&#039;t take over a week (he would give students more than about two weeks after the last class to write a research paper).",
