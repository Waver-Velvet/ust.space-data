    "description": "This is a graduate-level seminar that offers an overview of theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of political culture. The study of culture is highly interdisciplinary, and this course surveys insights from fields such as political science, economics, public policy, psychology, evolutionary biology and anthropology. We will define the term culture using the tools of social science and discuss questions including where culture comes from, how culture is transmitted, and how culture changes. We then examine the possible implications of culture in areas such as economic growth, public goods provision, ethnicity, and social movement. Throughout the course, will read analyses drawn from many parts of the world, particularly Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe.",
