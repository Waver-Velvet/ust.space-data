    "name": "Quantitative Data Analysis for Social Research I",
    "description": "This course focuses on practical aspects and implementation of social data analysis by introducing basic yet hands-on techniques for presenting, analyzing, and interpreting quantitative data, many of which are rarely taught in a regular statistics course. It is deliberately designed as complementary to a formal and theoretically-oriented introductory statistics course. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of the course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn to real-world data. Upon completion of the course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as a better understanding of quantitative social scientific research. Not to be taken by students admitted to BSc Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards.",

Using plain language, the course introduces basic statistical concepts and<br />shows how to analyze real-world data using the statistical program R. Specifically, the course (1) cov-<br />ers basic practices of analyzing data for social science research, such as data management, descriptive<br />analysis, and correlation; (2) introduces basic idea and intuition on causality; and (3) demonstrates<br />how the aforementioned practices are actually executed with real-world data using R.",

Specifically, every week:<br />• On Tuesday (in the classroom): You will aĴend the face-to-face class meeting and are expected<br />to participate in discussions and other activities. The meeting will involve practices using R.<br />Please bring your laptop to class.<br />• On Thursday (online learning): Lecture notes and videos will be released through Canvas by<br />12:00pm. You will watch the videos at your paces and according to your preferred time (before<br />our class meeting next Tuesday). A few questions for discussion in class will be listed at the end<br />of each lecture.",

      "comment_teaching": "Honestly the course is not taught in the best way. The instructor taught in a clear way, and it&#039;s certain that he&#039;d made careful plans for his teaching and had stuck to it. He is also patient, and is always willing to answer questions. <br />However, as least from my perspective, the correlation between knowledge points was not empathised, which made summarisation and revision a little difficult, and the professor sometimes failed to identify the parts of the contents that are complicated and hard to understand (i.e., he spent quite some time on things that are easy). This made his classes tedious and the learning atmosphere quite inactive. <br />Another thing that adds to the difficulty in learning is that he didn&#039;t give answers to quizzes. It&#039;s sometimes disturbing. So try your best not to miss too much things in class.",

There were four quizzes, each weighed 10% and included 10 MC, and a final with 30 MCs which consisted 30% of the total grade. The rest depends on participation. Go to class, answer a couple of questions and you&#039;ll have full mark.",

Out of class work is needed, either to memorise the concepts or to get familiar with R.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say that the most important thing is to follow the course.

So the review before 2017-2018 Spring is no longer valid. <br /><br />The professor kept excusing himself that he&#039;s teaching 3 courses this term, but I don&#039;t care. The professor was undoubtedly unprepared and didn&#039;t seem confident about what he was offering to his students. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think the content is the problem for this course. It teaches basic stuff related to statistics in Social Science Research. Not too technical, but because the professor tries to avoid technical stuff, the course ends up going no where + repetitive. <br /><br />Stuff like: <br /><br />Sources of social data<br />Data Generating Processes<br />Variables<br />Data Manipuation<br />Describing Uni-variate Distribution<br />Two-way table<br />Compare distribution between Groups<br />Scatterplot, Correlation, OLS<br />Regression Analysis<br />Causality &amp; Study Design<br />Hierarchical Data Structure<br /><br />are taught.",

No matter how many times I tell him about the course, he is not willing to fix those mistakes and make the course student-friendly.",
