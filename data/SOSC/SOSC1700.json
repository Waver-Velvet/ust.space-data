    "name": "What Is Democracy?",
    "description": "This course introduces classic theories of democracy from ancient Greece to the contemporary world. It examines both normative justification and reasoned critiques of democracy. It will discuss the normative foundations of democracy, the relationship between individual rights and rule by majority; the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and how to conceptualize the common good or public interest in democracy. It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world.",

      "comment_content": "Basically, the course studies the evolution of democracy, from Plato to Robert Dahl, and inquires into the theories raised by different political philosophers.<br /><br />In the end, the following philosophers were studied in SOSC1700:<br />*Plato, et. al. (there are some more people involved in his writing)<br />*Aristotle<br />*Machiavelli<br />*Thomas Hobbes<br />*Locke<br />*Rousseau<br />*Thomas Paine<br />*Tocqueville<br />*John Mill<br />*Robert Dahl<br />*Joseph Schumpeter<br />*Karl Marx<br />*Carl Schmitt",
      "comment_teaching": "Speaking of the lecturer, one may worry if Professor He has his own political bias (given by his Mainland background). But to the end of the course, I don&#039;t see anything that constitute as exerting one&#039;s political bias in his lesson. He&#039;s also eager to use often controversial current affairs to exemplify the course&#039;s material, such as using the National Security Law when explaining how should the &quot;common good&quot; be defined.<br /><br />In terms of communication, Professor He responds to questions asked in class swiftly, and assignments are returned with detailed comments, critiques and suggestions.<br /><br />Regarding accent, Professor He&#039;s Mainland accent is quite heavy tbh. I&#039;m OK with accents as long as it don&#039;t seriously affect understanding, but those who are affected should take notice.",
      "comment_grading": "Participation (10%)<br />3 weekly responses (20%): (B+, A-, A)<br />Group project (30%): A<br />Essay (40%): A-<br /><br />The grades for participation includes activity and questions asked in lessons (either spoken or typed in chatbox), and activities in Canvas&#039; discussion board. Although to prevent unnecessary hassle, please seriously consider think twice and check your content before you post: This is a politics course after all.<br /><br />Weekly responses are to be submitted before professor starts a new lesson on a new philosopher&#039;s view, and is related to your opinion towards the philosopher&#039;s view. That said, Professor He said that he may change the weekly responses to short essays regarding specific problems and questions in future sems.<br /><br />Ultimately get an A. Combined with information on MSSSUG regarding other courses by Professor He, you should get a sufficiently good grade and have a good (some said genuine actually) experience in liberal art education if you sufficiently participated in the course.",
      "comment_workload": "Average workload. I mean the workload is really averaged.<br /><br />While the course doesn&#039;t have frequent assignments, the 3 weekly responses are extremely heavy, as you&#039;ll be diving into loads of ancient English scripts written by the philosophers, understand their views, and end up with a piece of response, critically challenging their views.<br /><br />You&#039;re advised to complete all responses after the course commences, as the points and views by the earlier philosophers should be easier to debunk and dismantle. A Chinese or modern English translation of the course materials can be extremely handy in understanding the views of the philosophers, as a number of works are written in archaic medieval English.<br /><br />You got approximately a week to work with the essay, in which you&#039;ll choose 1 in 2 topics. The essay is to be completed by a group of 2-3, in which you should finalize the list of group members in late April. These shouldn&#039;t be too hard if you attended all lessons and have sufficient knowledge on current affairs.",
