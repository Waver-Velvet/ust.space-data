    "description": "This course covers both normative and psychological aspects of decision making with specific reference to marketing and consumer decisions. The course will introduce the building blocks of decision making such as belief and utility assessment and will contrast the economic models of decision making with psychological models that take into account various biases in judgments and choices. The course will also introduce experimental design and analysis relevant for marketing decisions and will discuss the marketing applications of behavioral decision research.",

Most of the chapters just have calculation problems, but they are not too hard, just memorize formula then you will be fine. While a few other chapters require memorization, but they are about some psychological theories so it is quite interesting.",
