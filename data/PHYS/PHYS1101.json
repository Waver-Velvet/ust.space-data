It is not a preparatory course for PHYS 1111; students with no calculus background who plan to take General Physics should take calculus concurrently with PHYS 1101 so that they meet the prerequisites for PHYS 1112. Topics covered include heat and gases, force and motion, waves, and electricity and magnetism. Students without HKDSE qualifications may seek instructor’s approval for enrolment.",

I would say as long as you keep up with lecturers, complete your weekly assignments and attempt more questions from the textbook, you will be able to do well in this course. Also, the IA will give some Worked Examples pdfs from the textbook, and I found those really helpful for the assignments as it teaches you how to answer typical questions.<br /><br />Note that there is no theory questions in the exam, it is purely calculations, so make sure to jot down all the relevant formulas in your cheat sheet. I think all the questions in the midterm and finalterm exams were extracted from the textbook, so if you practice more then you&#039;re bound to encounter at least a few similar questions in the exam!<br /><br />Grading-wise, I think they were quite lenient with marks.

I hadn&#039;t studied physics for 2 years but still did well even though I did not attend/watch a single lecture or tutorial. <br /><br />I preferred to study the content by just reading the slides and watching youtube videos if I didn&#039;t understand anything<br /><br />Textbook is very useful as it includes worked examples and basically all the exam questions are from the end of chapter questions from the textbook. Tutorial and homework questions are good for practice.",

Then didn&#039;t go to lectures or study anything after mid terms either so I was very far behind and then once again, this time I gave 4 days or so for finals and yeah. So I think just try using other resources such as the organic chemistry tutor and honestly you will understand everything.<br /><br />trust me the course is doable and worst case scenario, just make a really good cheat sheet though I barely used them in the exams",
