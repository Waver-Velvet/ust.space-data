    "description": "Soft-condensed matter is one of the frontier fields in science nowadays and is the \ngateway to the vast field of bio-related sciences and new materials. Topics \ninclude: theory of solution, polymer chains and gels, surface tension and wetting, \nliquid crystals, colloid and Brownian motion, thermal fluctuations and diffusion. \nUndergraduate knowledge of thermodynamics and statistical physics are pre-\nrequisite. Emphasis will be on establishing the fundamental concepts and \nprinciples as well as training te necessary theoretical tools for research in soft-\nmatter systems.",
