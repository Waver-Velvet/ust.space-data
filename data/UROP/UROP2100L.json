    "description": "This is the second course of the four-course Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) series, which allows students to engage in faculty-led research projects that can span up to four terms. Successful completion of UROP 1100 is a prerequisite for proceeding to UROP 2100, which can involve either the same or a different project led by the same faculty supervisor. Progression from UROP 1100 to UROP 4100, regardless of whether it is on the same or a different research project, must be under the guidance of the same faculty supervisor. In case of a change in faculty supervisor, students need to restart from UROP 1100. Approval by faculty supervisor(s) is required. Students are required to submit a written report upon completion of the course. Graded P or F.",
