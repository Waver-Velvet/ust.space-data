It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advices and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

Another is joining the sports classes provided by the school which are held in Fall or Spring depending on your class. For me, I studied that in the Spring sem.<br /><br />Last but not least is the Community Meetings that are held twice in the whole semester, both of them are held in the form of talk. Mainly focus on mental health and future job issues.",
      "comment_teaching": "The video is a pre-recorded video, there are no limitations on the time of watching. For the sports classes, I took the badminton class, and they mainly taught the basic skill.

An advice would be to attend the workshops in summer first to lower your workload after sem starts.<br />5) Surveys: have some surveys to fill in with deadlines",
