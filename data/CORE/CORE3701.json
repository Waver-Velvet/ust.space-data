    "name": "Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach",
    "description": "This course introduces some new directions in the study of Chinese history and social science. It aims to demonstrate how a new scholarship of discovery using a data analytic approach is redefining what is singular about modern Chinese history and social science. The course offers alternative perspectives into China derived from 40 years of empirical analyses of almost 10 million records of historical Chinese microdata, distinguishable from those perspectives based largely on Western experience or on Chinese experience seen through a Western lens. Students will benefit from the development of critical thinking skills and the ability to question received wisdom on Chinese history and social science.",
