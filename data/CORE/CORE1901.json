It is quite similar to LS if you are DSE students (Bye bye LS for students from 2025). Also note that both the midterm and final are open book but I would recommend you memorising all materials as your cheatsheet may not include all the stuff and you missed some detail. ( For instance I mess up the if A then B and no A then no B stuff, losing 1 question in the midterm, showing if no full mark in midterm then no A+, so be extra careful with that). Do learn how to apply those concepts and you can ace the final. (Doesn&#039;t mean an A+)",

I didn&#039;t enjoy the science and technology module that much, but for the sake of the other sections, I&#039;ll give it a high rating. One thing is that the teaching isn&#039;t directly related to the assignments in the modules, since the TAs are in charge of the essays and the professors just determine the content by themselves, so it is a bit subjective.",

I would say the grading is a bit confusing since the participation points are overly specific and nobody got full marks. Even though I went to and talked in every class I couldn&#039;t get the highest mark so I don&#039;t know what they consider. The midterm and final exams did not have enough practice and we didn&#039;t know how it would be right until we got the papers.<br />On the other hand, the essay grading was the most clearly understandable one and I feel like I could improve my second essay thanks to the feedback from the first one.",

To top it off, when you do speak (bc it is a MUST to get the participation grade) during class, the TA doesn’t even look at you a lot of the times or sometimes, I barely even see them so who’s even keeping track?? You can’t even see your grade after every class to be alert so you are forced to accept whatever outcome you get.",
