      "comment_content": "Check out what others said.<br />He required us to buy papers by ourselves. You only start to write Chinese Calligraphy after add-drop. Please drop it as soon as possible. The course required you to master Chinese calligraphy in 3 weeks after semester start. You need to finish writing the Chinese poem in an hour, which is nearly impossible for beginners but he won&#039;t make any arrangements and only ask you to practise more.<br />The course is extremely unreasonable. You have hours of lesson listening to him talking about the History of Chinese calligraphy. But all your grade depends on how well you write while you only have 30 minutes actually writing Chinese Calligraphy in the tutorials.",
      "comment_teaching": "Worst teacher ever... He only rate the student based on Chinese Calligraphy skills. He himself can&#039;t even write pretty calligraphy, we have asked him to demonstrated once, it leaves us speechless. He is not an expert in chinese calligraphy, not even in chinese history or literature. He switches between English, Cantonese and Putonghua in the lesson but his English and Putonghua are poor. We tried so hard to write Calligraphy but the ink keep splitting on the paper. We asked him and he said it was a skill issue. But later when we&#039;re doing the project and we do some research and found out that the problem is the paper. The paper he asked us to buy is for Chinese painting so the ink can spread so easily. The paper for Chinese Calligraphy should be another type of paper. You also need to hear him judging your piece while him being such a non-professional.",
      "comment_grading": "It&#039;s a disaster really. I know nothing about Chinese Calligraphy and got a D. I put many hours into it but apparently there&#039;s only small amount of students and some have at least learn Chinese calligraphy for 3-5 years. The grading should be cumulative. If you are not a master of Chinese Calligraphy, just don&#039;t reg this course. I never got C range or D in any other courses.",
      "comment_workload": "The teacher asked us how many hours we practise a week. At least 4 to 5 hours sound good to him. I thought this is a beginner friendly course for anyone that wants to pick up a new hobby or experience. Even you try to practise every day for few hours, if he still think you write poorly, he won&#039;t appreciate any effort and ask you to do more practices. The workload is severely heavy. There&#039;s also a project that require you to put anything related to Chinese Calligraphy inside that A4 art book.",

      "comment_teaching": "The worst instructor I&#039;ve seen in my life. His teaching is a piece of shit. Lecture is 2 hours, followed by 1 hour tutorial. Lecture is mainly about development of caligraphy, and about masterpieces. Instructor demonstrates a boring lesson perfectly. <br /><br />He always tell the students to not hesitate to ask questions, but he obviously feels annoyed when people really do so, and ask other students to answer your stupid questions, etc.<br /><br />I am a local student, but I can&#039;t understand what he is saying and what&#039;s his main idea. He always switched between English to Cantonese, causing an inconsistency for what he&#039;s saying. I really wonder if the non-locals can understand his speech. Sometimes he tried to speak Mandarin, but he needs students to guide him lol.<br /><br />But still, the attendance are high, because it is counted towards the grading. I still get a C even though attended every lessons.<br /><br />In the tutorial, you will bring your own brush and practice writing. Instructor won&#039;t &#039;teach&#039; you, he would just put the masterpiece on canvas and tell you to imitate the writings. <br />I&#039;ve never given a E on any course, he managed to do so, good job!",

So he can give any grade he wants lol.<br /><br />I get a C finally. I appreciate his generosity for not giving me D or F. <br /><br />If you try this course because you have experience in primary school, I promise you can get similar grade.",
      "comment_workload": "Basically the workload is from the learning portfolio.<br />Another workload is to waste 3 hours per week to listen to his boring lecture for attendance. <br />PS: After you&#039;ve finished your portfolio, he will tell you that you don&#039;t need to submit the sketchbook version, only need to submit the digital version on canvas.",
