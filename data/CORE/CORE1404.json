    "description": "This course puts a strong emphasis on developing university-level academic literacy and communication competence in writing, speaking, and multimodal contexts. The course introduces students to research skills using university library resources for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students’ competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

      "comment_content": "I will not repeat what the other reviews have already said.<br /><br />Mandatory courses in HKUST can indicate one of two things:<br />- This course will contain information that will be useful to you<br />- This course will be a complete waste of your time<br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on doing research / writing papers, this course will teach you citation skills (and make you understand that this isn&#039;t HKDSE English Writing Paper 2 - you can&#039;t make shit up).<br /><br />You are probably not one of those people.<br /><br />The content for the first half of the course is *tangentially* related to our assignments. Think of your first three years of secondary school in English class (or if you&#039;re a foreigner, the entirety of middle school). It&#039;s like that.<br /><br />ASSIGNMENTS (Assuming the assignments don&#039;t change in the coming years):<br />Your research will build upon itself as you continue with the assignments. SAVE YOUR SOURCES. YOU WILL NEED THEM FOR FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS. Download them and put them in a folder for easier access later.<br /><br />ALWAYS ATTEND CONSULTATIONS. ALWAYS ASK THE INSTRUCTOR IF YOU&#039;RE UNSURE ABOUT LITERALLY ANYTHING.<br /><br />You will be provided with themes, and within those themes are sub-topics you can choose from (eg Livable Cities - Urban Shift, Sustainable Living - e-waste). Do NOT follow your instincts and pick a non-contentious, &quot;easy-to-research&quot;, familiar topic, like carbon footprint. It will make your synthesis paper, presentation, and e-magazine harder do.<br /><br />Instead, pick topics like culture, which have a lot of sides to it, allowing you to form unique arguments.<br /><br />Because if you&#039;re boring and argue that you support the global reduction of carbon footprints, the instructor will roll his eyes and fall asleep. And if you try to argue against that, then you&#039;re a moronic dipshit.<br /><br /><br />You will not understand what you&#039;re supposed to do for the annotated bibliography. That is normal. Ask the teachers, do your own research, look at samples, and you will be fine.<br /><br />I think I was put in the sweatiest CORE 1404 section, because right after the teacher gave feedback on our draft, one of my classmates emailed all of us and told us to exchange feedback with one another in a google drive. Around 8 people did so and it was moderately helpful.<br /><br />You can probably do the same thing with your class as well.<br /><br /><br />For the synthesis paper, the hardest part (for me, because I picked the incredibly non-contentious topic &quot;carbon footprint&quot;) was literally the thesis statement, ie deciding what main point I was arguing. (This is why you don&#039;t pick boring topics!!!)<br /><br /><br />The presentation is not difficult - if you&#039;re sweaty, just do it like how you did your secondary school / high school presentations. Good graphics are optional - the audience (instructor) is looking at you, not the tiny words you have printed on the screen. I got away with white text in coloured rectangles on a blue background.<br /><br />PRACTICE WITH YOUR GROUPMATES BEFOREHAND. Book a room in the library and go through the whole routine at least once. Bring a wireless mouse so as to click through the slides without being right next to the computer. (And if you do bring a wireless mouse, put it on a table so you don&#039;t accidentally right click while holding it during your presentation, and have to spend like ten seconds fixing it.)<br /><br />Do NOT go even remotely over the time limit. Have a timer app running on your phone and placed somewhere you can see when you present. (You can prop it up on a table using a water bottle.) During practice, make sure to be ~30 seconds under the time limit. This gives you leeway during the actual presentation.<br /><br /><br />For the e-magazine, I have good news for you. Since there&#039;s an entry requirement to CORE 1404, all of your groupmates are at least somewhat sweaty. This means that no matter how bad you think you did, your at least still not going to bomb the 10% given for group coherence + multi-modality.<br /><br />MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE DESIGN OF YOUR E-MAG IS CONSISTENT. I&#039;m talking font and font size, colour palette, margins, everything.",

I have absolutely zero idea whether that statement is true or not.<br /><br />85% --&gt; A (I calculated it myself.)<br /><br />My classmates didn&#039;t seem to be that fortunate however. A few of them asked me what I got for my annotated bibliography, and they were like &quot;bro you got advanced/exceptional?&quot;",
      "comment_workload": "If you&#039;re extra sweaty, you will be like me and finish your assignments way before you have to submit them. You will then spend endless hours staring at your doc, wondering why it still doesn&#039;t &quot;look right&quot;.<br /><br />A bulk of your time will be taken up by research. By &quot;research&quot; I mean grabbing only the sources that support your viewpoint, plus a few extra that are against your viewpoint so you can make counter arguments for bonus points.<br /><br />I do not know how many hours total I spent on my assignments. Do I want to know? Probably not.",

Also, given that most business students need to use Chicago/Turbian and that most engineering students need to use IEEE for future research papers, the precise formatting of APA is not useful at all.<br /><br />Thus, given the already vague grading and the almost instant 0 marks Susan gives out for citations she deems incorrect, the teaching for the course is somewhat unhelpful, inapplicable, and unforgiving.",

This also means that it is quite hard to start working on the assignments in the first few weeks because the sample materials are only released 1 or 2 weeks before the deadline.<br /><br />I spent a total of 72 hours on this course (both in class and assignments)<br />Lessons (1.5 hours each) and consultations (usually 30-60 minutes) add up to roughly 34 hours, and another 38 hours for assignments:<br />- Research: 3 hours<br />- Annotated Bibliography: 12 hours (~4 hours each)<br />- Seminar: 8 hours<br />- E-magazine: 8 hours<br />- Self-reflections: 1 hour?<br /><br />During the final lesson, there was a discussion with the whole class, and some students mentioned that this class had the heaviest workload, but personally I felt that it was fine if you manage your time well.
