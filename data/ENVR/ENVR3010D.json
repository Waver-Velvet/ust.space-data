    "name": "Sustainable UST: Management Ideas in Action II",
    "description": "HKUST is a dynamic university, constantly changing, and filled with opportunities to reshape the way it operates into a more sustainable-driven institution. This course focuses on how change happens at HKUST, how to manage those changes, and how to ensure that changes can be done through the application of a set of sustainability principles and guidelines. Using practical theories and management tools, students will explore how sustainability can provide a powerful framework for solving problems and developing new management strategies. Students will then take those new tools and apply them in real-life projects on the HKUST campus that have the potential to create meaningful and lasting changes. Students will experience first-hand the power of sustainable thinking and how these concepts can be applied across all disciplines. The course will highlight several areas that contribute to the foundation of sustainable thinking: change management, systems thinking, community-based social marketing, and the role of identities and behaviors. There will be an emphasis on building practical project management skills so that when students develop their hands-on assignment, they will be prepared to address a challenge on campus and develop a sustainable solution. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
