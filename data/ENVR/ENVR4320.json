    "name": "ESG Management and Reporting",
    "description": "This course examines key frameworks for organizations to report their ESG performance. Following a flipped classroom (blended learning) approach, students are guided to collect corporate ESG data, comment on quality of ESG reporting, discuss issues on ESG disclosure, and study real-world cases of how various organizations manage their climate related financial risk. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on collective learning via division of labour: each student group presents their findings on ESG reporting and management in a specific industry, so that the whole class learn about a wide array of industries from their peers.",

      "comment_teaching": "terrible teaching. literally the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. the slides are messy, there is never a clear point, first 8 lecs rush through all the concepts, don&#039;t take away anything from it, then drone on and on about specific aspects of esg ratings without any clear takeaway. Lovely, can I have my time back please?<br /><br />As an example - For the final, I pushed through to rewatch all the lectures, understand all the concepts, and literally quoted the prof and concepts he said for the definition section - still got below mean. They don&#039;t even think what they taught in class is the correct answer AHAHHA",
      "comment_grading": "Absolutely terrible. Vague instructions, completely biased. You will spend more time trying to understand what it is they want than actually learning anything. <br /><br />I was so frustrated I asked the teaching team why I got so many marks deducted for &#039;presentation of ideas&#039; they said, I should explain more clearly. Thanks, that is very unhelpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As mentioned above, they don&#039;t even know what they want. If you do badly in this course, its actually a compliment, it means you won&#039;t end up doing data entry at a big four for minimum wage, congrats!",
      "comment_workload": "you spend a lot of time doing bullshit projects of little consequence - projects, midterm, group assignment, individual assignment, group presentation, individual presentation -&nbsp;&nbsp;if you care about stupid things that don&#039;t matter this is THE course for you.",
