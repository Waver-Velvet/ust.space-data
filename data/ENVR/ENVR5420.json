    "name": "Climate Finance and the Carbon Markets",
    "description": "The world’s businesses and governments must take aggressive and coordinated steps in order to avert a climate catastrophe. Climate finance (investments in systems, companies and projects that sequester carbon) and the creation of new financial instruments that price carbon emissions – is a critical part of this required transformation of the global economy. This course will explore the economic and environmental impacts of climate change and the financial tools that can be used to mitigate those impacts and accelerate the sequestration and capture of carbon. Focus areas are: capital markets and exchanges, emissions trading systems, investments in low emissions technologies, project finance for nature-based climate solutions, renewable energy and other project types, corporate finance of decarbonization beyond their value change, carbon credits/offsets, and related regulatory changes.",
