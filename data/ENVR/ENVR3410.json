    "description": "This course examines the economic theories behind environmental policy-making. Key concepts include externalities, common resources, market failures, polluter pays principle, and free market environmentalism. Several methods of non-market valuation of environmental goods are illustrated with real-world examples. Basic game theory is applied to understand the logic of collective actions. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on fostering an intuitive understanding of the topics from an economist’s point of view.",

      "comment_content": "Please refer to the previous review for the content.<br /><br />I have zero knowledge in economics as engineering student, just put fair amount of effort and you will do great!<br /><br />The course is very fair in my opinion. Whether the course is good for you or not, really depends on your effort. You will be rewarded for it.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Keith is really passionate about teaching. He will take time to answer student questions and even offer another half hour to stay after class to clear all doubts the student have. He is very friendly and happy to answer any questions, so don&#039;t be afraid to ask! He is a game theorist from Cambridge, so he knows his stuff",
      "comment_grading": "I would say it is really fair, i got A+ at the end. Read his lectures and practice his question, and you will do well :)",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is fair. There are no assignments, but there are written project and final presentation. I would say with regular meeting and effort, they are manageable.",
