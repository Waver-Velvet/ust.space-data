    "description": "The integration of environmental and social practices is crucial to address environmental crises, including climate change, pollution, resource scarcity and social wellbeing. Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts.",

      "comment_content": "Part 1: Sustainable Development - Environmental Impacts &amp; Sustainability metrics (8-9 classes)<br />The first part of the class focuses on how society can develop more sustainably with an examination of critical issues like energy and food provision. It further considers a range of environmental impacts and sustainability metrics that can be used to drive more sustainable decisions. Other methods to measure sustainability will be covered towards the end of the course.<br /><br />Part 2: LCA Concepts and Applications (6-7 classes)<br />The second part of the class focuses on questions like &#039;What is LCA?&#039;&#039; and introduces LCA as a framework for evaluation of the environmental footprint of products and systems. It covers the basic terms and concepts of LCA, as outlined in the respective global (ISO) standards. LCA case studies will be used to analyze how these concepts are put into practice, and what role LCA<br />software plays in the process. At the end of this part, the limitations of the LCA technique, as well as its applicability for consumer product assessment and marketing, will be discussed.<br /><br />Part 3: LCA Modelling Skills (8-9 classes)<br />The third part comprises case studies, tutorials and practical exercises using current software tools to provide students with a hands-on experience of conducting LCA. Students will learn how to set up LCA plans, how to model different scenarios, how to identify environmental hotspots of product systems, and how to plot and interpret the results. Furthermore, students will complete a small project setting up their own LCA.",
      "comment_teaching": "This is the first semester they changed the syllabus, which combined with the LCA course. Since it was the first time they had taught this syllabus, I guess they overestimated the content and did not have enough time to cover everything. However, Meike and Zhongming are both nice professors willing to answer all the questions regarding the course content and the projects.",

      "comment_content": "The course covers mainly &quot;theories&quot;. It takes quite some reading and perhaps imagination to understand some of the concepts discussed in class, but they are useful in this course and in general. Good command in English is essential given the reading required.<br />The course gives you the opportunity to go to ReThink, which is the best thing about this course.",
      "comment_teaching": "It is hard to recall what happened in lectures. The professor has a baritone voice and the lecture is 1:30pm perfect for an afternoon nap. Many students, including myself, find lecture content baffling. People mostly do their own thing in class, and only read content related to assignment (your topic / sector) only.<br />My peers have also asked the Professor about the recommended readings, but the Professor seem to not know about the content and research according to them.<br />Sometimes there will be group discussions but they are very light-hearted.",
      "comment_grading": "No written exams, only writing and presentation. <br />As far as I know, you need to write in a way that is understandable by a senile white man. The professor seem to have a hard time understanding written assignments in non-standard English (&quot;perhaps Chinglish&quot;) and will not give them a decent score. <br /><br />The first assignment is based on ReThink, and students have to write about what happened at ReThink with respect to 2 sectors, using concepts taught in class. (A)<br />The group presentation is based on an assigned topic (covered in class) and a sector (grouped by priorities). I think the instructions for this assignment is lacking. (B-)<br />The Final Report is based on the sector same as the one in the group presentation. It has a &quot;group component&quot; and &quot;individual component&quot; but it is not defined clearly.

You don&#039;t really need to write a lot because in the ppt he provided, there are some speaker notes you can refer to. Not sure if the speaker notes help when you do revision because for our year we don&#039;t have a final exam.<br />Prof. Patchell is very nice and willing to answer students&#039; questions.

One group project was related to the course content, you present the idea you have learned in your selected industry. It should be around 20 minutes.<br />The final group project was everything you learned in the course and you just need to apply it to your selected industry.",
