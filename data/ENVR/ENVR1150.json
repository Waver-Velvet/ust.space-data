    "description": "As the extreme weather events emerge as one of the most prominent global risks, climate change and the accompanying natural disasters are no longer a side agenda, but play a critical role in maintaining sustainable societies and economies. This course aims to inspire students to take a broader perspective on environmental issues, in addition to advancing the scientific knowledge of climate change and extreme weather. To effectively achieve this purpose, the course introduces the case studies that emphasize the huge implications of extreme events (e.g. drought, flood, heat waves, typhoon) and their linkage with the warming due to greenhouse gases. This course also assesses the potential impacts of climate changes and extremes on social, economic and environmental sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "comment_content": "I think the other reviews cover this part. It&#039;s simply a load of climate change stuff and stuff. Here&#039;s a breakdown of the course grading scheme (I&#039;ll talk more about my scores and grade in the grading section)<br />- 5&nbsp;&nbsp;open-book quizzes in total (60%). Initially, this was supposed to be a pop-up meaning she would take quizzes on random classes without any prior announcement.. Because of heavy backlash from all of us after the first quiz, she decided to fix the dates. They not necessarily hard as long as you revise the ppts and gain a good understanding of the materials. But many of us struggled with the time so you guys better prep! <br />Quiz 1,2,3&nbsp;&nbsp;were worth 10% each.<br />Quiz 4,5 were worth 15% each<br /><br />-Report I. Excel project (30%): Prof gives you a long ass excel file full of data on precipitation and temperature anomalies for 7 different locations. We are tasked to analyze the uncertainty, create graphical representations, and pick 2 out of the 7 cities we deem to be highly vulnerable to climate change. All of this must be presented into a 4-page ppt. Sounds tough but most of the concepts are covered extensively in class and there are also TA sessions for excel tutorials. Making the project file takes a long time though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give it a minimum of 2 full days if you wanna come up with anything appropriate. If you&#039;re aiming for the top and you have some innovative ideas, you&#039;ll probably need to invest more time. Students are grouped as excellent/very good/good.. so on and the prof gives you a score based on that (100/90/80....). Only 2 students got excellent fyi<br /><br />-Report II. Written assignment(10%) : You are given two different TED talks with opposing views on a certain topic mostly related to climate change, and you need to choose to support/oppose one of these in your report. 250 words limit. Rubric for assesment is 40% for clarity (meaning you make it clear who you&#039;re supporting), 30% logical flow and 30% objectivity. Students are grouped as excellent/very good/good.. so on and the prof gives you a score based on that (100/90/80....)",
      "comment_teaching": "I think she teaches pretty well. She emphasizes the important stuff during her lectures and she&#039;s willing to take questions after class. The only reason I gave her a B is because of her heavy Korean accent. I personally don&#039;t find it hard to understand but I know a lot of my classmates struggled early on so just tryna give y&#039;all a heads up on this.",
      "comment_grading": "Alright fellas, time for the main portion. (TLDR: I got an A with a 90.57% overall) <br /><br />Each score is scaled in proportion to the highest raw mark achieved by a student. So if the highest score was 80/100 and your score was 60/100, your scaled score would (60/80)*100=75. Here are the SCALED scores for my quizzes and&nbsp;&nbsp;the corresponding mean for each section. They&#039;re all out of a 100 and if it wasn&#039;t already obvious, the highest for each is a 100.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My score&nbsp;&nbsp;| Mean<br />Quiz 1: 95.1 | 61.2<br />Quiz 2: 90.7 |&nbsp;&nbsp;67.1<br />Quiz3:&nbsp;&nbsp;100 | 76.5<br />Quiz4:&nbsp;&nbsp;84.4 | 71<br />Quiz5:&nbsp;&nbsp;102.2 | 76.7<br />ReportI: 80 |&nbsp;&nbsp;70.4<br />ReportII:&nbsp;&nbsp;100 | No data<br />Quiz 5 probably requires some explanation. My initial score was 90-smth but we later uncovered a grading mistake so my actual raw score was higher than the original highest. Instead of rescaling the scores(and probably killing everyone else in the process lol) she decided to give me this and considered the additional scores under the same weighting.<br /><br />My overall score on this course was 90.57%. Threshold for A+ was 91.7. I was ranked fourth in the class fyi. I got an A. top 4 out of a class of 86 people lol. Sounds harsh for anyone aiming for A+. Not sure how the lower echelons of grading look lol no offense to some of ya!",
      "comment_workload": "The quizzes and report II don&#039;t necessarily take too much time. But the excel project holy crap!

According to a senior, it&#039;s a watered down version of ENVR 4000O but you don&#039;t have to make your own climate model. However, as this was the first year of the course, the content may have changed since I took it.<br /><br />Pay attention to the true/false questions she uses as review at the start of class as they may appear on the exams, and make sure you understand what the graphs and diagrams are trying to say. Sometimes she will specify which things she will test on the exams.<br /><br />Main topics covered include: climate modelling, natural disasters, and IPCC reports/scenarios on climate change.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Im&#039;s accent is difficult to understand at first. Ever since learning how to understand her, no other professor&#039;s accent has challenged me. If you listen in class, you will understand her more gradually until at midterm you realise just how much your English comprehension has improved.<br /><br />She&#039;s a very passionate professor and she does her best!!!!! Even if you can&#039;t understand at first listen carefully - she&#039;s super nice, will answer your questions. Don&#039;t hurt her!",
      "comment_grading": "It seems very fair. Assignments are moderated, exam grade curve appears not heavily skewed.<br /><br />Aside from exams are the assignments. With the report, she will force all the top marks to present their report so you can feel your self-esteem going down or at least understand why your grade is not that great in comparison. (Non-top marks do not need to present.)<br /><br />Midterm: 30%<br />Data analysis report: 20%<br />Short essay: 10%<br />Final: 40%",
      "comment_workload": "Considering it is a 1000 level common core, it is somewhat difficult. Exams are just exams, but the data analysis will challenge you if you&#039;ve never done anything like it:<br /><br />Short essay - as the title suggests. Only 300 words to give commentary comparing two selected TED talks. Should be no stress.<br /><br />Data analysis report - this is what challenged a lot of people. She will give A LOT of data - I&#039;ll say that again, A LOT OF DATA. Task is to analyse the data however you choose (so people don&#039;t know what to do) and justify which locations will be most heavily hit by heat waves.<br /><br />The key here is you have to decide what you want to do with your data. My advice would be to think of a criteria to judge how bad the heat wave (or whatever) would be, and then score or rank the locations based on your criteria, like grading scores. Then explain why. <br /><br />Actually, I&#039;m writing this review because someone taking the course this year complained to someone who took the course with me last year that they had too much data for the report. Last year we had 16 pages of excel sheets in 8 columns and 400 rows each, covering RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, plus historical data for each location. Prof has already heavily reduced the data since last year by over 75% and done the wet bulb calculation for the students this year, so the main challenge is just in deciding what to do with the data and not calculating wet bulb as well.",

The contents will only go into more details and specifics.",
