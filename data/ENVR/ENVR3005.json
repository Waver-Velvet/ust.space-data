    "name": "Environmental Sustainability: Risks and Challenges",
    "description": "Environmental changes, whether natural or human-induced, pose potential threats or losses to the environment and society. Called environmental risks, they can affect human health, economic development, and social stability in significant ways. Therefore, it is crucial to use scientific methods, tools, and frameworks to assess and manage these risks effectively. In this course, students will learn the concepts, principles, and methods of environmental risk assessment and management. They will also learn how to identify, quantify, assess, mitigate, and disclose environmental risks and opportunities in environmental policies, projects, or actions. Students will explore the causes, impacts, and responses of different types of environmental risks. They will also consider how these risks intersect with social justice issues, and how they can challenge and transform the power structures and inequalities that underlie environmental challenges. Finally, students will apply their knowledge and skills to real-world case studies, using various tools and frameworks, as well as understand the importance of transparent environmental risk reporting in corporate finance.",
