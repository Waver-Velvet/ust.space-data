      "comment_grading": "Extremely easy grading. There are two exams - midterm and final. Both of these are subjective. The exams might seem difficult while writing them, but once the grades are released, you will find yourself with a score much higher than what you expected.<br />I, for example, was scared I might get a low 50s or 60s score in the midterm. I ended up with 92. Similarly, I got a 95 on the final, with the class highest as 98.<br />Participation is extremely easy to do using the chat function of Zoom, as long as a person skims through the case studies before class. The case studies are guided and led by Pavel and are not very difficult if you have a knack for the content.<br />As for the final project, there are three assignments - project proposal (ungraded - a form of written consultation), project presentation (ungraded - a form of online feedback session) and final report (graded). The professor usually tells everything you need to change for the report after the presentation, which makes it easy to understand his expectations.<br />Ended up with an A.",

      "comment_content": "Generally talk about different strategies for a company to expand its business to overseas. If you are interested in strategic consulting, perhaps you may find the content of the course quite interesting. Topics like entry strategies, country analysis, marketing, supply chain and HR management strategies for a firm to further develop in overseas countries are included in class. Case studies regarding each topics will be discussed as well.",
      "comment_teaching": "Frankly speaking, Pavel&#039;s teaching can be the worst I have ever experienced in UST. His accent is so heavy that most of the time, students (even for native english speaking exchange students) have to ask him to repeat what he said. His accent makes it super difficult to catch what he says. Besides, he just simply reads out every word written on the PPT, while his slides are quite wordy. You may sometimes find it hard to understand the content. One thing I found a bit ridiculous is that he requires students to answer questions for getting marks for participation. However, he does not ask questions during those &#039;ordinary&#039; classes which lectures are held, he only asks questions during those &#039;case studies classes&#039;; yet, there are only 6 cases included throughout the semester. It will be quite hard for every students to get a chance to answer questions in all cases in such case.<br /><br />Despite his very outstanding academic and career background, Pavel&#039;s teaching truly has great room for improvement :)",
      "comment_grading": "Grading:<br />Attendance (including quizzes): 10<br />Participation :&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br />Mid-term exam :&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br />Final exam :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 <br />Group final project :30<br /><br />Really poor for my case:( <br />I got above mean for my mid term and attended all classes (completed all quizzes), below mean for my group project, and final exam was cancelled without any replacements. And my grade turns out to be a C. I asked for the final grade breakdown and was told that I was at the bottom tier for participation. However, I did answered questions during class, I found it quite unreasonable to get a bottom tier score for participation. I feel like it is totally just based on impression which sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty unfair. <br /><br />Besides, for attendance, you are asked not only to complete the iprs quizzes right at the beginning of each class, but the accuracy rate also matters. If you answer the questions but you did not choose the correct answer, you cannot get full mark in such case.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload for this class is manageable. Not much to do, except the attendance part might be a bit harsh if you are taking a 9 am lesson as they start the iprs quiz exactly at 9am. You probably will miss the quiz even if you are just a few minutes late. <br /><br />Whereas for the group project, I find it a bit confusing. Not so sure what should be included and discussed in the report as very few guidelines are provided. There are also quite a lot of exchange students taking this class, you might find it a bit hard to gather people around for working on the project when you have 2/3 exchange students.&nbsp;&nbsp;And unfortunately for my group, there are a few freeriders, making the workload for the project quite heavy.",

      "comment_content": "The course is basically divided into 2 parts:<br />Part I: Globalisation &amp; the International Business Environment<br />Contents regarding globalisation, international economies and political systems, with content freshly designed, including trade war and Brexit as course content. (This is basically the first course I have ever taken in UST with such a fresh and up-to-date course content lol)<br />Prof studied politics in her university degree, so she is very knowledgeable in this particular module of content and very worth paying attention to her every lecture<br /><br />Part II: Corporate Strategy &amp; Management in the International Business Environment<br />Basically an advanced version of mgmt 4210,&nbsp;&nbsp;cover MNC&#039;s organisational structure and their globalisation strategy",
      "comment_teaching": "Mary is very humorous and you can feel her passion especially when she is sharing political issues <br />She also encourages in-class interaction and will recognise active participants at class <br />During her lecture, she will verbally explains and elaborate many contents that only has 1-2 sentence in the ppt, so you will need to concentrate on what she explains in class",
      "comment_grading": "Absolute Grading <br />Class Participation: 20/100<br />Mary will mark down students&#039; name who contribute valuable answer to her question or raise challenging question to count the participation, there is also iPRS attendance for every lecture<br /><br />Exam I &amp; II: Each 20, 40/100 in total<br />Basically Essay Question, in-class 1-hour exam <br />Essay Questions for lecture materials and case studies<br />Question is not straight-forward to lecture materials and require in-depth understanding of content<br /><br />Individual Case Analysis: 20/100<br />There are 5 cases for the entire course, choose one and complete the case analysis on assigned date, Mary will ask you to share your analysis on the assigned lecture for case discussion<br /><br />Group Project - Country Analysis: 20/100<br />5-6 in a group, do an Analysis on assigned country and respective industry by using different framework taught in class, and complete a 15min presentation, no need to submit any report<br /><br />If you can get 80/100, you can guarantee an A range",
      "comment_workload": "Very light workload<br />Only one individual case analysis and a group presentation<br />PRS on each lecture only acts for taking attendance, not any form of quizzes <br />Just make sure you read the 5 case studies on assigned lecture for case discussion",
