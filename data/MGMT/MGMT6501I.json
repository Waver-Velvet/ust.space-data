    "name": "Developing Effective Advisory Relationships",
    "description": "This is a course about working effectively with clients. Strong analytical skills and business knowledge are foundational to making an impact, but not enough on their own. Influencing others also requires productive working relationships. This course is designed for full-time MBA students who may spend part of their careers in roles where they will advise clients: consultants (including “in-house”), investment bankers, client relationship managers, etc. The lessons can also be applied to a range of other business relationships you will need (with supervisors, colleagues, direct reports, JV partners, etc.). You may also hire advisors in the future. Understanding the principles of effective advisory relationships can help you choose the right advisors and establish productive relationships. The course will primarily focus on the ‘day-to-day’ client relationship practices that will help establish you as a competent professional, a trusted advisor, and an influential change leader. As a secondary benefit, you will gain an appreciation for how high performing professional service firms operate. To maximize your learning, we will identify specific ways you can put these insights to work during internships or your first job after graduation.",
