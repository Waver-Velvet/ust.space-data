    "description": "The course introduces students to core legal principles of transnational economic law and the mechanisms for the settlement of trade and investment disputes. The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures examine how domestic laws, and regional and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",

      "comment_teaching": "Little bit boring with 3 hrs, esp those without any law background. The slides have so many words. Dini is nice guy but makes sure you pay attention or else he would &quot;remind&quot; students to pay attention in class.",
      "comment_grading": "Pretty Good Grade (A), don&#039;t be scared away by the content!<br /><br />We didn&#039;t know SD coz Dini only released letter grade, we only know mid-term grade. (Dini said the class perform poor hence he only released letter grade lol)<br /><br />* Mandatory readings are super helpful!! <br /><br />I google the concepts &amp; use ChatGPT to do revision, becoz sometimes google cannot find the exact concept/legal clauses. Comprehension &amp; knowing how to apply concept are more important than memorizing the notes like &quot;when WTO was established&quot;. In the exams, we were asked some important concepts like Article 38 source, what is customary international law with examples, prepare /memorize 1-2 examples would be helpful",
      "comment_workload": "Little, 1 mid-term, 1 presentation, 1 final exam, but only 1 week preparation for each group with &gt;100 pages of case is rush. However the ppt just summarize the case with a lot of texts copy &amp; paste so reading the case takes a lot of time.",
