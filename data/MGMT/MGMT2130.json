      "comment_content": "It is interesting as it is helpful to figure out your personal value. It really helped you to think more about yourself and the business environment rather than only talk about boring ethics.<br /><br />The PVA exercise can be enjoyable and it helps you determine what values matter most to you. However, if you approach it as just another homework assignment, it can be challenging. My suggestion is to view it as an opportunity for personal development and aim to discover what truly matters to you.<br /><br />The simulation activity was enjoyable as well. It didn&#039;t require any preparation beforehand, so you could simply engage in it during the lecture. Treat it like a game, and you&#039;ll do just fine.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Brown is one of the best professors I have experienced, in my opinion. He is enthusiastic, interesting, and energetic. You will thoroughly enjoy having a 3-hour course with him. He embodies my personal ideal lecture mode. His way of teaching is engaging and thought-provoking. If you don&#039;t have the opportunity to have him as your professor for this course, I suggest reconsidering taking it, as other prof may not be of the same calibre. The only relief in such a bad grade course is finding a good professor :)<br /><br />He will offer a one-to-one optional values chat (free coffee) if you are lost about your career pathway, it is strongly suggested to have a talk with him. You will be way more clear after the talk.",

I cannot comment because I have never tried it.<br /><br />One more thing, Participation really matters, participation in one lecture is roughly 2% in final grade.

So, our group had to agree to the fate of accepting the same grade as the person who didn&#039;t do anything throughout the whole project. Rather disappointing. For the other projects in this course, they were graded by Brown and his marking scheme is rather tight tbh. Need very detailed analysis to score well in his essays and assignments.",

No. Probably not. Would I take this if I have a lot of time and am heavily invested in the observation of the society? Yes. Do I recommend people to take Professor Brown specifically (note: I&#039;m not sure what other professors bring) Yes, only if you have a lot of time, am not afraid of speaking up, has decent language skills and always attends class.",

It uses a stakeholder management perspective to understand how firms can, do, and should behave in the economic environments in which they operate. The key purposes of this course are twofold. The first is to provide students with a set of analytical tools and concepts to better understand complex ethical and social issues confronting businesses today. The second purpose is to prompt students to understand their own values and their role in the business ecosystem; as customers, employees, community members, and future leaders.<br />The course is structured mainly as an experiential discussion seminar. There will be some lectures and videos, but mainly we endeavor to explore and challenge our ethical reasoning<br />through dialogues with each other, exchanging view points with classmates, and participating in experiential exercises. Students will be required to move seats during class, speak with new students, and engage with others individually and as a group.",

      "comment_content": "This intermediate business ethics course addresses issues of responsible decision-making at<br />the business and organizational level. It uses a stakeholder management perspective to<br />understand how firms do and should behave in the economic environments in which they<br />operate. The key purposes of this course are twofold. The first is to equip students with a set<br />of analytical tools to better understand complex ethical and social issues confronting business<br />leaders today. The second purpose is to encourage students to understand their own role in<br />the business ecosystem, as customers, employees, community members, and future leaders.<br />The learning specific objectives for this course seek to address multiple questions.<br />1. What is the responsibility of a for-profit firm in society?<br />2. What social and moral responsibilities do organizations have across stakeholder<br />groups?<br />3. How can a business approach tradeoffs between profit and purpose?<br />4. How do values (those of the organization, its employees, and the greater society)<br />influence firm decisions and behavior?<br />The course is structured mainly as a discussion seminar. There will be some lectures and<br />videos, but mostly we explore and challenge our ethical reasoning through dialogues with<br />each other and by participating in experiential exercises.",

      "comment_teaching": "First of all sorry to all who cant take Sam&#039;s course since he is going to leave UST. Sam is one of the most open mined professor I&#039;ve ever met. He is welcome to all questions or views, you can just raise your hand and start a discussion with him if you disagree with his claim. The in-class atmosphere is very chill and relaxed. You can exchange ideas with your groupmates, classmates and Sam. Sometimes he thinks our ideas are interesting and will ask follow-up questions to extend our thoughts. He also invited some guests to give talks which were really inspiring. This has to be the best MGMT that I&#039;ve ever taken.",

He is a person who got very high GPA during his college but he said he didn&#039;t remember anything. Many things in university are useless even you got a good grade, it&#039;s more important to search for the meaning of life.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading is good, he maximizes the A ranges and B ranges in the course. 25% A range he gave.<br /><br />Quiz: 34.5/37.5<br />Presentation: 15/15<br />Simulation: 46/46<br />Participation: 1.5/1.5<br /><br />Final grade: 97% A<br /><br />95% is B+, 98% is A+. The course is highly competitive, one MC one sub-grade. If I got one more MC then A+ but probably B+ if one more mistake. The mean is useless (around 10 for each quiz and 13.5 for the presentation)&nbsp;&nbsp;because if you got all the things in mean you probably can only get B at most. Therefore if you aim at good grades, aim full marks and don&#039;t look at the mean. The participation and simulation is full-mark guaranteed if you did it normally, to differentiate is the quizzes and presentation. If you can score full mark in 3 quizzes out out of 4, it will be easy for you to get an A+ even your presentation is not perfect.",
      "comment_workload": "Frankly speaking no workload, just finish all the instructions in the course. The simulations are easy, do it with friends and submit the debrief form to get full marks; Answer any question to get full mark in participation. The presentation is the only workload but if you are serious you will get full mark too. The quizzes are easy to score full marks, don&#039;t put too much effort, put more in other courses.",

I don&#039;t know how the fuck other people think this course workload is reasonable. 比UST Chur撚到傻左?<br /><br />10% Online news sharing: in your assigned week, share a news in CANVAS discussion, applying concepts. Keep tracking of your discussion throughout the week. Some crazy people will almost reply every single comment (2X comments). <br /><br />20% Quiz: 3 quizzes. Testing the lecture notes. This part is relatively chill, so the mean is 9/10.<br /><br />20% Role Plays: 2 case analysis on lessons. Discuss in group and type it on the online board. Quite stressful for introverts due to peer evaluation after the lesson. Also, need to present after typing the board.<br /><br />30% Group Project: Shoot a 10mins video talking on some on9 ethics issue. 學唔撚到D咩，做十幾頁slides係基本. 有D人為左呢個2 credit course，搞撚哂字幕, 整鳩埋動畫,Role Play埋扮professor,真係好Creative :) 究竟為左分可以去到幾撚盡<br /><br />5% Feed Back on 2 group projects: 400 words max. Also quite heavy workload as every group project has included so much contents to chur their grade and you need to read it or at least understand what they are trying to convey. <br /><br />For all the above, I get 70/85, ~83%, should be above mean.<br /><br />15% Participation: I only fk up this part, then get C range. Given that I participated all lessons, Mary rated me unsatisfactory just because I did not speak up in front of the class on my own initiative. 每堂抽十幾個名答問題，堂堂都好撚stressed，而且堂堂都有case studies, 要睇幾頁case/video<br /><br />結論: Introverts 就 deserve C range. no matter I did all the things required including typing thousands of words in this 2 fking credit course. <br /><br />真係好撚柒ethical. 仲好意思Claim自己做ethics course. 垃撚圾mgmt courses",

Super nice!<br />He didn’t force students to answer questions as well. Participation and answering questions do not affect your course grade. Just speak if you want to. Heaven to introverts!<br />His powerpoint is simple and his teaching is clear and to the point. Most of the students will not worry about the quiz because he just set questions that he has explained in the class. He said he don’t want students to study for a very long time to prepare for the quiz, so the quiz is quite short and easy to handle if you have attend his lecture.<br />Lastly, what I want to say is that he really impressed me. He said that students will forget everything after the course, but he wants his students to at least remember something in the course through his teaching. Very touching!",
      "comment_grading": "Very generous!<br />The quizzes will count the highest 3 out of 4.<br />Two stimulation games which are quite easy and interesting. (It is very fun and you can really learn something from the game!)<br />A video reflection to talk about what you have learned from the game by using course knowledge to explain it.<br /><br />I will say as long as students complete everything on time, and pay some attention in quizzes and reflection, A range is nearly guaranteed.",
      "comment_workload": "Throughout the course I did not feel stressful at all, but professor did mention that there should be presentations/projects in normal class. Because this semester is online class, so it becomes stimulation games and video reflection.<br /><br />For the quizzes, every time is non cumulative. You only need probably 1-2 hours to prepare.<br />For the games, you will definitely find it interesting.<br />For the reflection, probably takes a day to work on. <br />That’s all!<br />But I think this semester is probably the lightest because there is no presentation~",

The mark of in-class participation was not disclosed. I did actively participate during lessons by answering at least one question. Also, there was PRS at the end of each lesson which is directly affecting the participation mark. If you really could not attend the lesson at the timeslot, you could sit other lectures taught by Mary without prior request.<br /><br />There were two role-play exercises which needed to study reading materials in order to get familiarize yourself with the topic going to be discussed. Then, you will be either assigned to a group by Mary or choose your own groupmate with a specific stakeholders and discuss the instructions. For the first role-play exercise, I was one of them to represent the group to express our opinions though I said something incorrect and luckily my groupmates reminded me. However, I did not speak up in the second role-play exercise. If you really could not attend the role-play exercise, requested attending another lecture.<br /><br />I wrote a lot in the first individual assignment, therefore, got the highest mark. Unfortunately, I wrote much less in the second individual assignment due to a lot of deadlines of assignments and projects which led to lower mark.<br /><br />For the group project, you can choose one out of four topics and then make powerpoint slides for presentation. I was surprised that Mary gave us a high mark because I did screw up in making PowerPoint and presentation. I was the one who mainly made the PowerPoint and one of them to do the presentation. Other groupmates are either freeriders or troublemakers. Our presentation got a low recognition from classmates showing in the vote of best presentation. Luckily, Mary is generous in grading our project.<br /><br />After the presentation, personal reflection on the presentation needs to be handed in. When I first saw the mark of personal reflection, I thought that I was screwed up the course again. After looking the mean, it is not a big difference compared with other students.<br /><br />I am really surprised by the grade of this course because I did not consider myself outperforming during the whole semester. I know other reviews advised that not to choose Mary. I am here to tell you, Mary is your best choice in order to ace A+ if you do actively participate in the class and do well in the three individual assignments. For the group project, wisely choose your groupmate and your life will be much easier.",

Overall a really good course that will stimulate our thinking. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why some students think ethics courses are useless. Believe me - you&#039;ll be shocked at how many students don&#039;t even know it&#039;s illegal for a ship captain not to exercise prudent seamanship.

This course focuses on the ethical issues related to the interaction between business and society. You will further develop your knowledge, moral reasoning skills, and attitudes towards social responsibility by considering the perspectives of various stakeholders. Corporate contexts sometimes involve ‘managerial mischief’ and ‘moral mazes’; thus having an awareness and sensitivity to Business Ethics can bring overall improvements. This highly interactive course will draw upon relevant current issues to help you understand (and overcome)<br />some of the real-world challenges that business executives confront. Ultimately, this course will encourage you to become positive, ethical influences in your own personal and professional lives.<br /><br />From my point of view, the content of this course is quite interesting as it explores us the complex business ethical issue nowadays which is useful to develop our &quot;water-blowing&quot; skills in future.",

Overall, the teaching was very good.",
      "comment_grading": "Your grade is mainly based on how much you participate in class. Melody marks down your name if you do speak up in class (as everyone has to put their name card on their desk every lesson). I think that it is crucial you attend all lessons as there are only 13 lessons and participation is HEAVILY depended on. <br /><br />There is also another essay and project which you have to do. The essay is a reflection journal on how you felt about the classes and what you learnt, which I don&#039;t think matters a lot to your grade as long as you hand it in on time. As for the project, I do think it is quite important and you must think on a deeper level to show that you have really put effort into the project. Also, most people made really professional presentations, so the presentation aspect is really important as well.",
      "comment_workload": "For those who rather do projects than take exams, you won&#039;t find that the workload is large. You would have to meet up a lot with your group mates to make sure that the project is completed.
