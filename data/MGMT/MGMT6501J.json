    "name": "Innovating via Entrepreneurship & Intrapreneurship",
    "description": "This elective course focuses on the essence of innovation – something that entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship have in common regardless whether it takes place in a startup, a large corporation, or a family business. It centers on an experiential learning program that will require students to develop and pitch an innovation-oriented project. Depending on the student’s career and life goals, this project may consist of a business plan for a startup, a project proposal for their corporate employers, or a new business line for their family businesses. At the end of the course, students will pitch their proposals to a panel of successful innovators whose careers spanned across intrapreneurship, entrepreneurship, and venture capital. Throughout the process, students will experience personal self-discovery and learn about practical tools for pursuing a career in innovation. The course is taught by two instructors: an academic turned entrepreneur and a product manager who began as an intrapreneur before becoming an entrepreneur and later, a venture capitalist.",
