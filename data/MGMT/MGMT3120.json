What traits, skills the leaders possess, how&#039;s the behaviour of leaders tend to be, more relationship-motivated or task-motivated, how a leader transform their subordinates to a better person and it&#039;s important to be an ethical leader. The knowledge may be quite abstract but it&#039;s pretty easy to understand. Moreover, there are some important frameworks and concepts taught which would be tested in the exams very likely.",
      "comment_teaching": "Very good professor who often carries out class discussion and give feedback to students every lesson, sometimes the discussion occupies for more than half of the time of the class. She has a good attitude, sometimes students answer too much but she still tries her best to give helpful feedback. The teaching speed is not fast which allows students to easily catch up the concepts, she also give examples.",
      "comment_grading": "Very good grading, didn&#039;t expect I would get an A since I got below mean in the first exam. The second exam is quite challenging because there are only 75 minutes for 4 essay questions, 13.75 marks for each question and each passage is quite long. The key to stand out in exam 2 is to be very clear with the concepts, fast reading and typing speed. Although the exam is open-book, it takes you time to locate the concepts, therefore it&#039;s important to have enough revision. Many people could not manage to finish the Exam 2 and lost mark for the final questions, I was lucky to finish it 5 minutes before the exam ended. How she graded the answers should be quite lenient since I got 54/55 in the exam.<br /><br />For the project, the presentation is more important than the report, 20% and 15%. She is a good grader that she often gives high marks to groups so the mean is high, just make sure not to include significant mistakes in the Powerpoint and prepare well for the Q&amp;A session during presentation.<br /><br />Learning Diary 8% (8/8)<br />Self-assessment 8% (8/8)<br />Exam1 14% (12/14) 23/25 Mean: 23.4<br />Exam2 25% (24/25) 54/55 Mean: 48.2<br />Team Project 35% (19/20+13/15) Mean: Present 17.8 Report 12.2<br />Participation 10% (?/10) I guess I have like maybe 8 at least<br /><br />Final Grade: A (84+?/100)<br /><br />Remember to submit the learning diaries and self-assessments, those are easy-earning points which you submit and gain full mark, she seems give no mercy to those who submit late, please remember to submit.<br /><br />The exams calculation is not normal, you got 1% less if you score 1 mark less in the exams. That means 55 = 25%, 54 = 24%, 52-53 = 23%, 51 = 22%, 50 = 21%...... Same calculation method for Exam 1, therefore it would be very painful for losing each mark. You can imagine in the Exam 2 not having time to do the last question will result in a disaster since the course is highly competitive (mean in Exam 1 which is MCs having mean at 23.4).<br /><br />The participation marks would be calculated in two parts, first part is the attendance of the presentation classes and the guest speaker session. The other part is the class discussion, if you contribute to it then you may earn extra credits from the 10% as the syllabus said.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is low. Those assessments just take you little time to finish. For the revision, it may take you some time but I jotted notes each lesson so I just used little time to revise for the exams. <br /><br />The big boss would be the project. I am very thankful to have very good groupmates which we all work really hard for the projects and divide the workload evenly(I think), therefore the workload is light. I myself am not a very professional in doing projects, but the teamwork we had had made us a great success in both preparing and finishing the projects, it was also a very fruitful and exciting opportunity to work with them. I would like to use this platform to say thank you to them, hope they would see it.",
