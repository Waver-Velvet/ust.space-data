    "description": "For students of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department only. This course contains two modules. For sensing, it covers basic sensing technologies in structural engineering. Students will learn about traditional (e.g., accelerometers) as well as state-of-art sensing technologies (e.g., fiber optic sensing) and their practical applications in civil engineering. It also covers vibration-based structural health monitoring. Students will learn about the fundamentals of structural behavior, and analysis in the time and frequency domain. For data science, this course introduces fundamental knowledge and practical applications of data science and machine learning in the structural engineering context, primarily from understanding and extracting informative patterns from structural sensing data. Students will also learn about the use of relevant software & toolboxes (Python) to apply the discussed data science concepts on structural sensing datasets.",
