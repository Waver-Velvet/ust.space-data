    "description": "This course describes the physics of the climate system and how it is represented in numerical models. It covers global environmental issues related to climate change resulting from both human activities and natural climate variations, and introduces the basic structures of climate models. This course aims to equip students with a solid understanding of the physical climate system and the underlying principles of current climate assessments. It teaches students which aspects of climate science are well understood and where quantitative uncertainties arise. As climate models are one of our primary tools for predicting and adapting to climate change, it is vital that we appreciate their strengths and limitations. The course includes a combination of lectures, homework assignments, a mid-term exam, and a term project of climate model analysis. The lectures provide students with fundamental knowledge of the physical processes in the climate system and basics of climate modeling. Homework assignments reinforce the knowledge base and enhance problem-solving skills for students. The mid-term exam will assess the learning outcome. The term project provides hands-on training on utilizing climate models to understand climate change and make informed decisions.",
