    "description": "This multi-faceted course encompasses advanced technologies in infrastructure and building construction, maintenance and operations. The course provides deep learning methods in computer vision and robot sensing with hands-on coding training on solving construction management problems with these methods. Combined with tools from AI and robotics, the course equips students with leading-edge knowledge and practices to bring about successful construction reform in the context of the smart city. The course is a mixture of lectures and student projects. The concept, theory and applications of AI and robotics in construction are delivered through lectures. The class also provides hands-on exercises on AI and robotics software development toolkits to learn how to apply these tools with given data. Through mini-projects, students explore the use of the toolkits for practical problem-solving in construction.",
