    "description": "This course contains two parts. The first part is about indoor environment of green building. It covers the four aspects of indoor environment quality (thermal, indoor air quality, lighting, and acoustic), building energy load calculation and energy efficient design. The second part covers the interaction between building and outdoor environment. Principles of radiation exchange, heat transfer and surface energy balance in the context of urban environment are included.",

      "comment_content": "I find the content to be abstract and uninteresting, this is solely my personal opinion, you might think it&#039;s interesting. The content is also very niche so cannot find online resources easily, you must rely on the professors. I highly recommend you don&#039;t miss any Jiachuan&#039;s (or second half) lectures because there are sample questions similar to homework questions.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching is very good, the professors are helpful when you ask them questions. However sometimes you are so confused that you don&#039;t even know what you don&#039;t know because the content is too abstract and hard to follow, you might not even know what to ask.",
      "comment_grading": "I believe the B I received totally reflects my effort, so I think the grading is fair. I usually spend 3 hours for each of hw, and 2 days studying for both midterm and final.",
      "comment_workload": "There is sufficient time for hw, but the questions are really hard and tricky. You might end up over-checking your answer that you waste a lot of time. This is because the content is so niche that you can only rely on professor&#039;s notes, google search usually gives you nothing, but there is always something you don&#039;t understand. <br /><br />It&#039;s very hard to do poorly in this class because there are always some straightforward homework or exam questions, if you read slides there is no way to do them wrong, but it&#039;s also hard to do very well because the contents are really hard to understand fully. I personally even find it hard to study because the content is not interesting.",

      "comment_content": "1st half was mainly about indoor environment such as how to design a building that has good internal air quality and how to reduce energy consumption. 2nd half was mainly on outdoor environment. The content is really hard to grasp as most of the things are mainly abstract and you kind of have to convince yourself to just understand the surface of the content rather than going in-depth as that would cause a lot of headaches.",

      "comment_grading": "This course is bell-curved, but don&#039;t know for what reason they require you to get 90/100 to get A+. I got highest in class with 88/100 and got an A even though it is bell curved. Maybe they are just trying to keep their standard high.<br /><br />midterm:35<br />final:35<br />hw:30",

      "comment_content": "Not quite civil to be honest. Most of the content is not relevant to building, but physics. Lighting environment, thermal, energy sustainability etc. I feel like that the content is about learning daily stuff in a complicated way. It’s the kind of course that teaches a lot of knowledge but you just can’t bring anything out with you. Of course it is just my subjective opinion. Overall, the content is quite abundant.",
      "comment_teaching": "Quite good. The professor is able to express his teaching content clearly and is able to answer students’ questions. Just normal teaching.",
      "comment_grading": "30% HW, 35% mid term, 35% Exam. Apologise here cuz I write this comment without finishing this course(not even midterm) so I am not sure how’s the grading here(moreover, I heard that it’s quite a new course). What I can say is that the HW is quite challenging. Hard to get full marks cuz there must be 1 to 2 questions that are confusing.",
      "comment_workload": "Tbh, I think the workload make sense: About one to two weeks, there will be one hw, which is normally about 2 to 3 pages. But the workload is heavier than other courses such as comp(Don’t compare it to Math or Phy). No individual project I think. Overall, reasonable workload. One more thing, all lectures will be taking place at 9a.m, which is quite annoying.",
