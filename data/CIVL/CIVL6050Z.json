      "comment_content": "The belief held by Leibniz that demonstrated an &quot;extremely close relationship&quot; between theology, philosophy, engineering, and mechanics was his view that the world is a vast machine designed by a powerful and wise creator. Leibniz believed that by understanding the mechanisms of machines, one could gain insights into the principles that govern the universe. He saw theology and philosophy as interconnected with engineering and mechanics, as they all sought to understand the workings of the universe.<br /><br />In 1676, Leibniz investigated the question of what happens when objects collide. He observed that when two objects collide, the movement of one object is transferred to the other. Leibniz referred to this transfer of motion as the &quot;living force.&quot; He considered the living force as a real physical substance that is exchanged during collisions. Leibniz argued that the world is a living machine, and God had put a quantity of living force into the machine at the time of creation. According to Leibniz, this living force would remain constant and conserved in the world. He sought to define and describe the living force mathematically.<br /><br />Leibniz also recognized that the release of living force could occur in powerful and violent ways, such as in the combustion of gunpowder, fire, and steam. He became fascinated with harnessing this released living force, as he believed it could provide humankind with immense power.<br /><br />Therefore, Leibniz&#039;s belief in the interconnectedness of theology, philosophy, engineering, and mechanics stemmed from his conviction that understanding machines and their mechanisms could lead to insights into the principles governing the universe.",
