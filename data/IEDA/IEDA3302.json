Ajay has joined HKUST 20 years and he could single-handly ace all the other professors here in HKUST in terms of teaching methodologies (including Desmond form CS). He could reduce every topics, from Lasso regression to PCA analysis to even RSA encryptions every single one of them, to basic algebra or even something simpler: &quot;PCA is just looking at these pens in this direction- oh they clumped together, that&#039;s not good :/, so we rotate-ate-ate- oh here! they are all spread now!&quot; BOOM!, that&#039;s the idea. I was like OMG that&#039;s it?! It is so much simpler than the COMP4331 I am taking! All advanced concepts, reduced to atom.

Foundations: Infrastructure and protocols of the web, sessions, security basics<br />2. Search: web as a graph, graph search basics, crawling basics<br />3. Visualization: simple interactive graphical informatics<br />4. Demand forecasting: Simple regression models, Bass diffusion model<br />5.
