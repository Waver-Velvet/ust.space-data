      "comment_content": "The course helps you discover yourself and prepares you for landing a job offer. The content seems to be the same as SCIE 1100.<br /><br />You can expect to learn about the whole process of finding a job:<br />- knowing thyself<br />- presenting yourself<br />- interacting with others professionally<br />- interviewing and other things you may encounter in a recruitment center<br /><br />For some lessons, there are special activities. The most significant ones are in week 8, week 10, and week 12. For week 8, we conversated with several invited professionals about their work and experience while enjoying meals. For week 10, we had group activities. In this semester, the major activities were building a catapult in a short amount of time and pretending to be mangement in a business case. For week 12, we had an almost real interview except that you don&#039;t get a job and the interviewer would say whether they will hire you. Failing this interview won&#039;t fail your course, so no need to stress about it.<br /><br />syllabus<br />- week 1: introduction and class logistics<br />- week 2: self-reflection worksheet; STRONG and DISCMap (MapsTell) as homework<br />- week 3: STRONG and DISCMap debriefing<br />- week 4: Portfolio Building I (Decode JD and CV Writing)<br />- week 5: Portfolio Building (II) CL, PS, LinkedIn and Career Mosaic: GNED2510 (T2) - Career Building<br />- week 6: Stress Management &amp; Mindset Shift GNED2510 (T2) - Career Building<br />- week 7: Career &amp; Employability Skills<br />- week 8: Networking Practicum<br />- week 9: Interview Like a Pro<br />- week 10: Leadership Assessment/Group Discussion Skills<br />- week 11: Final Drilling<br />- week 12: Mock Interview<br />- week 13: Last Class (get to end the lesson early in 60 instead of 110 minutes)<br /><br />assignments<br />- assignment 1: JD, CV &amp; Cover Letter (due Oct 11 -&gt; 13)<br />- assingment ?: Networking Practicum Reflection (due Nov 4)<br />- assignment 2: Video Interview Clips (due Nov 8 -&gt; 15)<br />- (the arrows mean the teacher delayed the deadline)",
      "comment_teaching": "Compared to other courses, it is a relatively interesting one. You can still get bored in class but definitely not as much as others. (The music on class is quite relaxing...)<br /><br />Grace is the main instructor and there are several TAs. They are very qualified to help you with your career. The instructor and TAs are friendly and interact with students freqently by asking questions. There are many group activities to talk with classmates.<br /><br />You can also book 1-to-1 career consultation with Grace or the TAs for free.",
      "comment_grading": "It is a DI/PA/F course so it is not accounted into your GPA. It is easy to pass it. If you want to fail, you need to do one of the following:<br />- Having &lt;80% attendance<br />- Skipping mandatory lessons<br />- Not doing homework on time<br />- Not participating at all on classes<br /><br />No scores were released. I got PA at last. But who cares! It doesn&#039;t count towards your CGA.<br /><br />weightings<br />- assignment 1: 20%<br />- assignment ?: ??%<br />- assignment 2: 20%<br />- participation: 10%<br />- attendance: 50% (So it is very important to attend all lessons!!!)<br /><br />grades<br />- distinction: &gt;=90%<br />- pass: &gt;=60%",
      "comment_workload": "Only 1 110-minute lesson per week. There may be tasks to do after class. The tasks are not something you need to burn midnight oil or brainpower on to complete though. So the only tough workload is attending the lessons, which is difficult for some people.",

You can just book a career advising session with her, which is very useful to me. I asked her about what job am I suitable to do, checked my CV and Cl, and also did a mock interview.",
