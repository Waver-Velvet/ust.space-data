    "description": "This course presents a modern introduction to international finance and open economy macroeconomics based on a micro-founded, dynamic general equilibrium approach. The first 4-5 weeks provide coverage of basic international finance topics including global imbalances, current account sustainability, theories to explain the current account, determinants of real exchange rates, and international capital integration. These foundation concepts, together with the knowledge you have gained in ECON 5140 are used to develop an understanding of modern graduate-level open economy macroeconomics. We will study international business cycles in data and models with increasing levels of sophistication including the open economy real business cycle model. Students will not only learn how to solve various models analytically using pen and paper but also through using numerical solution techniques in Matlab, Octave, and DYNARE, to compute the quantitative impact of economic shocks and policy events. Bonus computing workshops will be provided. Applications to policy and real-world phenomena are emphasized throughout. Assumed knowledge is ECON 5140.",
