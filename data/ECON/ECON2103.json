      "comment_content": "The content taught is actually rather useful for future devolopment. It helps you form a basic way of thinking like an economist, such as &quot;rational people think at the margin&quot;,&quot;people respond to incentives&quot;,etc. It is not so difficult to fully understand those things, but the point is that you should focus on building a way of thinking instead of memorizing things. If you are a science student, it is easier to accept those things, in my opinion.",

But I still got 93 :)",
      "comment_workload": "If you compare this course with something like CHEM 1030 which has no homework, I may give ECON2103 a C. However, to be honest, it does not take you too much time to get a good grade in this course. Usually it takes 2~3 hours a week to finish its problem sets (approximately 6 problems, 15 min each) and go over the corresponding chapter. But in fact it is much more easier to get an A+ than in MATH 1023. In addition, if you make proper attemps in your problem sets, you will get a full mark. And you can ignore 2 problem sets if you are too busy( Wing allow us to do so, I am not sure whether other professors do the same). Anyway, it worth taking 3~4 hours a week and review the content often because you&nbsp;&nbsp;can get a good grade by working hard.",

I only partly agree with this statement because I do think practices help. Before the two midterm exams, I finish all the exercise provided on mind tap though it is not required. And you&#039;ll find some identical questions on the exam paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Past papers help too (also may show identical questions), but you can only find the PP for the fist mid-term but not others. And Wing won&#039;t provide the answer to the exercise for the final he released on Canvas and neither did he allow his TA to make any comment on that. So for the final, it is better for you to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revise the textbook, the PPT(very important) and HW assignments(very important) and though Wing said final is cumulative, but I do think he tested more for the contents after Mid2 and similar questions to the exercise of the final he released did show up.

      "comment_content": "As the course is not for ones who got a passing grade in AL, or Level 3 or above in DSE Econ, the content is quite easy. (Opinion from an ordinary student without choosing Econ or any business side subject as elective)<br /><br />The topics before first (Yeah there are two) midterm are the fundamental basic things (meaning: basic of basic). It means that they won&#039;t be directly asked or questioned in exams (except first midterm). <br /><br />The topics after first mt are kind of case analysis, not some general theorems but case by case. <br /><br />In this course, logic is reasonably essential but not completely required. Common sense is the second important thing you will find useful.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Siu&#039;s teaching is good from personal perspective, but some of my friends, who are good at study, don&#039;t like his teaching. Although I agree that the lectures are filled with some obvious examples and less-relevant stories, they are still informative and intriguing. Flaws do not cover up strengths. At least I focus easily in his lectures I attended (skip some).",
      "comment_grading": "There are two grading schemes as mentioned by others. <br /><br />Prof. Siu stated that absolute grading is applied in this course. <br />From my personal calculation with previous data, the A+ cut-off is roughly ranging from 85% to 93%. <br /><br />Letter grade is still not yet released. If I get a good grade, I will update (AND IF I STILL REMEMBER). (A+ is doubtlessly to be a good grade)",
      "comment_workload": "If the workload of MATH1013 (or maybe 1003) is standardized as 1, the workload of this course is essentially and reasonably to be less then 1 (maybe 0.5 to 0.8). 1 PS per week, full mark for completion. (My friends: Even you submit a blank doc, probably you still get full mark)<br /><br />Repetitive revision is the icing on the cake but not a must if you understand most of the contents in the lecture. As stated by Prof. Siu, thinking is more important.",

He usually encourages us to think more deeply in a logical way. That is the thing I like about his teaching.<br /><br />However, he sometimes becomes off-topic during teaching. If he can save these times, I think he can teach more topics more deeply. Also, there is only one past paper for each exam to practice, which is not sufficient. I understand why he says past papers are not useful in achieving good grades in exams (because logic is important), but practice makes perfect. We should have sufficient sample papers to practice in order to apply the knowledge taught in the lectures. (at least 2-3 will be good enough).<br /><br />TA:<br />She is good at teaching (although I have only attended two tutorials) as she can explain the concepts quite clearly using sample questions. Her tutorial notes are clear and easy to understand for revision.<br /><br />Recommend watching the following Youtuber&#039;s videos if you find difficulty in learning concepts in the lectures or tutorials. He explains each topic starting from the basics.

Things like demand &amp; supply, Nash equilibrium and Game Theory, and different markets and its equilibriums is what I think is basic knowledge, and its very good to know if you have not done your own studies on them.<br /><br />The course outline states:<br />As an introductory course, this course will cover the fundamental concepts and tools involved in microeconomic analysis. Economics provides a powerful way of thinking that helps you<br />to understand many human and social phenomena. Real-world examples and cases will be used as much as possible to enhance your understanding.<br /><br />Textbook:<br />&quot;Principle of Microeconomics, Ninth edition” written by N.

The HWs never change over the semesters, so you could just search it up on Google or ask previous seniors who have taken the course.

And it can truly help us develop critical thinking towards real life problems.<br /><br />Btw, a good understanding of math differentiation and integration is not really necessary, but will help for sure. I am in fact an engineering student and understanding the math indeed helped in many ways.",

Many previous students says that Wing likes to give usless chats during lectures, and TBH, I enrolled this course not just because it&#039;s a CCC course, but I expected to &quot;have some fun&quot; attending his lectures as we were told that his lectures were like comedy shows LOL. But, as far as I&#039;m concerned, this sem, there is no comedy show. In fact, the way he delievers and approaches to different problems are really helpful, as the logic that he approaches to probems are exceedingly important. And reading the textbook helps you to familiarize with the concepts.<br /><br />In the final exam, you will see that the logic is EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT. The questions are really well designed that it seems as if anyone can answer it but only people who really understands the logic can get high scores. Personally, I attended all his lectures, and had indeed understood the logic Wing approaches to problems. And this kind of understanding is very rewarding. So Please make sure that you understand the logic he approaches to problems. and of course you need to understand the concept before understanding the logic.<br /><br />So, The lecture helps you with the logic and the textbook helps you with the concepts.",

Some contents are quite abstract when they are taught in lectures, but problem set questions will help you understand those concepts clearly with numerical situations.<br />2. As we all know, the final exam is the part that decides your final grade. First, I would say that the final exam questions are very beautiful and successful in the sense that if you don&#039;t really understand the concepts and logic behind them, it&#039;s almost impossible to get a good grade because the questions seem to be quite unrelated to the materials taught in the class and it seems that even people without economics learning can also answer those questions. But this is not true. If you answer those questions as if you have never learnt economics, it&#039;s no doubt that you will get a terrible score in the final exam. However, as long as you can see the nature of those questions, you&#039;ll find that they are exactly what he has taught in the lectures. Just follow the logic and it&#039;s simple to get a good grade. I have to say that Professor SIU designed those questions pretty well and this shows he is very professional. The final exam can distinguish students who have learnt something through this course and who haven&#039;t.",

Although a lot of the questions were available online, it took me hours to complete each (10 questions each with multiple sub-questions), but in the end they helped me to understand the concepts and the exam. PS2 required me to draw like 10 graphics (annoying since I had to scan each one and AirDrop it lmao). Start doing it a week before the deadline at the very least.<br /><br />IMO you need to understand deeply the concepts and relationships within (all of the exams were open book exams for me, so no need to memorize). Tutorials are optional, but make sure to practice from the tutorial question sets bcs some of them will appear in the exams. Good luck!",

This makes the mean rather high (about 80%), so revisions and hard work is really needed. Exam is designed to be long and demanding (which is the original wordings of Prof. Li who says this could increase the opportunity cost of cheating, which I think is reasonable). Turns out the mean is quite low (about 50%). As everyone has a not-so-high score, you don&#039;t need a very high marks to get a prominent grade.<br /><br />At last, attendance is not counted towards the grade, but it is not advised to skip the lessons. They are really useful.<br /><br />For me, I have done all assignments and +1sd in one of the midterm and the final, and turns out an A grade, which is good enough for me as a newcomer in the world of Economics.",

Usually each assignment has a deadline separated by one week so you don&#039;t need to rush them all the way. The questions are selected to be applicable and can be used as a revision of the topic in class. An assignment usually takes 1 to 1.5 hours to complete. Going through Microeconomics from 0 to 1 is not easy, but I think this course serves the purpose.",

This brings me to a final score of 93% (plus a bonus point) and a final grade B.<br />This is really disappointing cause I have tried my very best to study the course and spent most of my studying hours in this course in the semester. I guess this is probably because many people taking this course have dropped DSE econ or they have studied econ before. This results in an unreasonably high mean.

She does not allow any noise, except asking her questions during lessons! Sometimes, she plays videos that may help you understand more about economic concepts.

Personally, I got over 99%(if added bonus mark) in the course. Yet, I still only got an A. So, if you are aiming for the best, make sure you have to be very careful with every question cuz a single careless mistake may result in dropping a sub grade.<br /><br />Kind reminder: try to put lots of effort into the first midterm, as the questions are easier, the competition between classmates are smaller(most of them had not yet realized what awaits them), and you can go for full marks if you are careful enough.",

There are practices provided by the TA, if you have limited time, I suggest you to focus working on those practices and get familiar with them.

I always fall asleep as he spent so much time on easy and boring concepts, but I do like his sharing on his life experience. <br />The textbook is very well-written and I think it is worth reading. As a beginner who have no economics background in high school, I can follow the textbook with no difficulty.<br />The tutorial is a bit too concise, but it&#039;s good enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the tutorials twice, and the teaching is OK.",

BUT I just wanna say that the econ material was not quite easy to follow, as I was a total beginner in econ. The powerpoint by Siu was not organized well, so you need to refer to the textbook or watch youtube videos to learn by yourself. The monopoly and oligopoly chapters were the most difficult parts in this course, and they appeared in the long questions in final exam, so please make sure you are familiar with those chapters.",
      "comment_teaching": "Siu was bad in time management. He often got off-tracked and shared too much on his personal stuff. He liked to jump slides when he taught, so sometimes I cannot follow his teaching. Someone might find his lecture interesting though, because he talked about life lessons and all that, but I really want him to focus more on the econ concepts.<br /><br />However, TA Guo Bing was good and her notes were quite useful. She summarized the lecture in an organized way and she was willing to answer students&#039; questions.",

The mean marks for the 2 midterms were about 80%, so you really need to score high in order to get an A. The final exam was harder, as the mean was only about 50%.<br /><br />I managed to score higher than the mean for every exam, eventually my grade fell within the B range.",

In this course, I will show you that economics provides a powerful way of thinking that can help you understand many human and social phenomena, and also enrich you in a wide range of career choices. I willuse real world examples and cases as much as possible in order to enhance your understanding of course materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, I would like all of you to come up with your own “definition” or“meaning” of economics and establish its applicability in your daily life.Textbook:“Principle of Microeconomics, Seventh edition” written by N. Gregory Mankiw, published bySouth-Western, Cengage&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplementary&nbsp;&nbsp;readings&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;be posted on the CourseWebsite (if any).Learning Outcome – School Intended Learning Outcomes (“SILOs”):1.Explain the methodology of microeconomic analysis, including key assumptions used,how economics differs from the other social science disciplines, and the strengths andlimitations of this analysis framework (SILOs # 1 and 4). 2.Describe the key concepts and tools of microeconomic analysis, such as gain from tradeand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specialization,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficiency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ismeasured, how the market structure affects the determination of price and quantitytransacted, and decision-making by buyers and producers under constraints (SILOs # 1, 3and 4).3.Examine the role of government and its interaction with the free market by evaluatinggovernment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justifications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgovernment intervention or participation, such as to maintain the public good (SILOs # 1,3 and 4).1<br />4.Apply economic tools and principles to identify, analyze and propose explanations forand solutions to real world issues (SILOs # 1 3 and 4).

Examinations and Grades:Quizzes and Problem sets:You will be assigned 10 quizzes and 3 problem sets during the semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quizzes (MCQsonly) are assigned on a weekly basis and submitted on the canvas. Each quiz remains activeon the canvas for one week. By default, only one attempt is allowed. Quizzes are credited bysubmissions. You have to turn in your own problem sets (hard copy) before the deadline announced.Suggested answers with detailed explanation will be posted on the Course Website after thedeadline of each problem set. Please note that NO late submissions will be accepted. In case you are sick and cannot handin Problem sets on time, please email TA before 5pm on the due date with completed2<br />problem set attached. In addition, the hard copy of your completed problem set, togetherwith a valid medical or legal document, should be submitted to TA no later than the firsttutorial following the due date. Midterm and Final Exams:There will be Two (in class) midterm exams. The midterm exam will cover lecture materials,problem sets and assigned reading (if any). The final exam is CUMULATIVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may contain multiple-choice, true &amp; false questions andessay-type questions, which require explanation in writing, graph and calculation.Overall Score of Grading for the Course:Your overall score for the course will be computed according to one of the following two schemes,whichever yields the higher score. This means that a low score in a midterm exam will not loweryour course grade, and it always makes sense to take both midterm exams. As you can see, a goodscore can raise your grade, but a low score will not lower it.Scheme (1): Course score with TWO midterms Assessment ActivitiesWeightingProblem Sets10%Quizzes10%Midterm Exam ((1) and (2))20%+20%Final exam (cumulative)40%Scheme (2): Course score with ONE midtermAssessment ActivitiesWeightingProblem Sets10%Quizzes10%Midterm Exam ((1) or (2), the higher one)30%Final exam (cumulative)50%Absence from Midterm and Final Exam:If for any reason you are unable to attend the midterm or final exam, you mustseekapproval of absence from me directly BEFORE the exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your request should be supportedby valid documents, such as medical certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner.Absence from an exam without prior approval of absence would result in ZERO score.There will be NO makeup for any Midterm exams. If you miss both midterm exams for anyreasons, you will receive ZERO for your midterm exams. For students who are absent from the final exam with prior approval, a make-up exam willbe arranged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make-up exam will be scheduled as soon as possible and should be within oneweek after the official final exam date (to be announced). It is the responsibility for thosewho request for a make-up exam to ensure their availability. The make-up arrangement canbe in&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of written-exam, oral exam or research paper, etc. Please NOTE that theinstructor has the final discretion on all arrangements of the make-up exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students whorequest for the make-up final exam should comply all the requirements as communicatedby the instructor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failing to meet any requirement may result in a ZERO score.3<br />Academic Honesty and Integrity:Academic integrity and honesty are key values at HKUST. Please read the information on academicintegrity carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is your responsibility to be familiarized with the Academic Honor Code and thecontent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ishttp://www.ust.hk/provost/integrity. The Code will be STRICTLY enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will report any cases tothe University WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS.I will try my best to make the course requirements as clear as possible. When you have anyquestion or you encounter any difficulties in studying, please do not hesitate to consult me either inor out of class throughout the semester. I am delighted to help you succeed in the course. Please beaware that ultimately it is you EARNING the grade, not me GIVING you the grade. So, when thegrade is out, one thing I will NOT do is to change your grade if what you want (need) is different from what you get.Classroom Etiquette:You are expected to be punctual for both lectures and tutorials; I will start and end the lecture on time. You are welcome to bring your laptop or other devices to lectures for learning purposes. Respect the others in class and do not disturb others with side conversation, Internet surfing, emails-checking or instant-messaging during class time. No eating in class at anytime",

It really helps us remember the content and stay engaged in class. As this course also involves some calculus and basic mathematics, his way of teaching really does help and it really is nice to get some words of wisdom for life in general here and there.<br /><br />I only have two criticisms for his teaching. One would be his lack of explanation on how he would grade the finals (how we should format our answers for the short questions). Whereas the second is his pacing for some classes. Since we had spent about two to three lessons on just the principals of economics instead of just one (I thought one would be enough, but it was just stretched because of some unnecessary and repeated but rephrased questions asked in class). Due to this, we had to have two extra lessons during the study week or late in the evening on random days.<br /><br />On another note, GUO, Bing&#039;s tutorials are very well structured and straight to the point. it is a great revision class.",

      "comment_content": "The content starts off very easy but gets much harder as it progresses. Those marked with 🔷 are easy topics. But starting from topics marked with 🔶, such as the cost curves in firm production and firms&#039; decision under different market structures, rigorous mathematical and graphical reasoning are required. In these topics, you will see different curves intersecting seemingly randomly like a fountain (but indeed with a rationale behind), and what math noobs can do is to stare at the lecture ppts and remain puzzled. So this course isn&#039;t really for math noobs.<br /><br />Topics included:<br />🔷 Ten Principles of Economics<br />🔷 Thinking Like an Economist<br />🔷 Interdependence and the Gains from Trade<br />🔷 The Market Forces of Supply and Demand<br />🔷 Elasticity and Its Applications<br />🔷 Efficiency of Market<br />🔷 Government meets Market<br />🔶 The Costs of Production<br />🔶 Firms in Perfect Competitive Market<br />🔶 Monopoly<br />🔶 Strategic Interaction and Oligology<br /><br />The final exam was an absolute mind blower compared to the strikingly easy midterms. It required us to answer long questions with full economic analysis backed by graphs and economic concepts. Algebraic equations are needed in the oligopoly part and those who are bad at algebra can screw up the final exam easily.<br /><br />DON&#039;T TAKE THIS COURSE if you&#039;re a math noob!!!",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof Siu Kam Wing might be popular among all the students as he often digresses, and turns his lectures into life lessons. Lectures were dominated by mainland students in the front rows and as they had much better mathematical reasoning than most of the locals, he resorted to a more mathematical approach in explaining the concepts, and what maths dumbs like me could do was just to freak out and stay confused.<br /><br />The TA is from ECOF and his tutorials are even more &quot;mathematical&quot; than Wing&#039;s lecture. He does the mathematical proofs of basically everything which isn&#039;t needed in the exams and the whole course at all. He fails to explain the very basic concepts and I doubt whether he himself actually understands them.<br /><br />DON&#039;T TAKE THIS COURSE if you&#039;re a math noob!!!",

The median was about 34/40 for the first midterm and 35/40 for the second one. Given such a high median mark, a few careless mistakes could kill.<br /><br />As this course must follow the grading guideline given by the business school, there can only be 20% students getting A range, another 40% getting B range and the remaining 40% getting C range. Landing on the median only results in a B-. Though I luckily got an A, most of my friends ended up in B- or even C range. The grading itself is not harsh indeed, but coupled with our super-capable competitors that semester (don&#039;t know why), many of my friends got below mean and eventually screwed up their final grade.<br /><br />✏️ 1st midterm: 38/40 (+0.72 SD)<br />✏️ 2nd midterm: 36/40 (+0.48 SD)<br />✏️ Final exam: 84/100 (+1.06 SD)<br /><br />💯 Grade: A",

Waste of time as professor gets distracted and goes off-topic. Tutorials are not interesting or helpful, it seems the TA is off-sync with the lectures.<br /><br />The professor says he really wants to help his students and seems approachable but is actually not when you really need it.

Like the other reviews explain there are 2 midterms (MCs) and a final (MCs, short Q&#039;s, long Q&#039;s).<br /><br />By personal experience, the midterms are easy to score above mean + sd in if you have done the content well (lecture slides and textbook), mean is pretty high too. Final (cumulative syllabus) is hard in the sense some questions have multiple concepts combined that may make it hard to answer in the long questions. Marking is strict by the TAs and it is hard to argue with them in short questions and long questions.<br /><br />*Terrible choice* as a common core or business minor requirement. Return on investment? Not good. There are better courses out there for you believe me.",

      "comment_content": "This course is about the basic principles of Microeconomics, which is an essential part for all the business students. It is also useful for students from other schools to simply dip into the business world for a bit. Overall, the content of this course is not difficult if you are willing to read textbook often.",
      "comment_teaching": "Wing is a very humorous instructor. He always uses simple examples to illustrate the hard principles, which greatly arouse students&#039; interest for economics. Besides, he loves to interact with students after class, so feel free to ask him questions (about economics and other things as well!).",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is pretty fair according to the mid-term and final exam grades. Both exams are of medium difficulty and very suitable for beginners. Assignments do count only if you didn&#039;t hand in them before deadline.",
      "comment_workload": "There is a weekly problem set for which you have to read textbooks carefully and understand all the concepts to get the answer. Also, it is recommended that you preview the lessons before class so that you could easily follow the instructor&#039;s pace.",

For everyone who&#039;s not a born-genius, an actual workaholic, or being controlled by grades in order to satisfy our family&#039;s perception of being a genius full of success, then just do your best and you&#039;ll get commonly a B.",

For Problem Sets, I suggest that you work together, because all questions are the same and time can be immensely saved.<br />For Exams, you could work together to figure out the given essay question beforehand, but you could also work together on the whole exam if you want desperately to fail. For normal students, study hard and work independently on the exam.",
