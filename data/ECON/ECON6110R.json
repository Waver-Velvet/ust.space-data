    "description": "This course deals with the relationship between macroeconomic variables and asset markets, emphasizing investment implications. It develops a formal macroeconomic framework for analysing the impact of policy decisions and economic shocks on major asset classes - equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, among others. While the framework is global and multi-asset, the focus is on Asia-Pacific equity markets. The use of data, whether it be via the use of factor analysis or the use and interpretation of economic and market related indicators, is emphasized throughout. The important role of central banks and monetary policy in the relationship between policy and asset prices, is a common theme. Real world examples – either current or from first-hand experience – are commonly used alongside theory.",
