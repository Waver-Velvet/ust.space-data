    "description": "This course applies machine learning to solve economic and financial problems, including residential property valuation, GDP and recession forecasting, default risk prediction, credit card fraud detection, portfolio analysis, volatility prediction, and market anomaly detection. It maps those problems into relevant supervised/unsupervised learning tasks and introduces basic machine learning methods. Students will get hands-on experience with machine learning to analyze practical business problems.",
