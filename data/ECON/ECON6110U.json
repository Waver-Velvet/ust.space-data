    "description": "This course introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which stresses the need to incorporate psychological considerations into economics. This is accomplished by making psychologically-sound assumptions about preferences, beliefs, and constrained maximization to account for a wide range of behavior. The course covers three topics: (1) decision making under risk (loss aversion, probability weighting, reference dependence); (2) decision making across time (self-control, timing preference), (3) other-regarding preference (altruism, fairness, reciprocity). Evidence from financial market, saving behavior, labor market and other areas will be used to show how behavioral economics can be fruitfully applied to yield important insights into behavior under different settings. The course emphasizes the interplay among observable behavior, underlying psychology, and economic models. Overall, this course aims to help you develop skills on (1) how to incorporate psychology could help explain economic behavior, (2) how to apply behavioral economics to various economic and business settings.",
