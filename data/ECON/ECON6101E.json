    "description": "This course provides an introduction to international finance and the interdependence with monetary policy. It examines the markets for key assets, demonstrating the impact of economic shocks and policy events and the relationship between financial markets and the real economy. It develops rich modeling frameworks, building on those in ECON 5200 and introducing some models for pricing assets, with a particular emphasis on bond and foreign exchange markets. Some recent topics include: COVID-19, Brexit, the Global Financial Crisis, and contemporary issues such as the resurgence of inflation. While students will read global case studies (Asia, Europe, South America), the emphasis will be on analyzing current events in real time, such as communications from central banks and global policy bodies such as the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank or the IMF.",
