You can really learn things by attending his lessons. Although no attendance is required, still recommend to attend!!! (p.s.

My friends from the other sections (different prof) only need to revise 6 chapters in the midterm. Unfair!<br /><br />Challenging topics (but he loved most, always appeared at practice/ problem set/ past paper/ exam)<br />Utility, indifference curve<br />Oligopoly (game theory/ prisoner&#039;s dilemma mixed up with Bertrand competition and cournot competition)",
      "comment_teaching": "I could feel his passion for teaching, but sadly, I got confused after attending his lessons. He always said something which contradicted DSE econ concepts or even from his ppt! For example, fixed cost still exists in the long run. He was willing to answer questions patiently. Yet, I was still confused by his replies. I resort to my friends and the textbook. You should buy the textbook when you reg his course! The explanation of the theories was better although the textbook was so wordy.<br /><br />Don&#039;t expect you to quickly absorb the new knowledge/ concepts from the lecture, particularly for Ch8 Utility and Demand and Ch9 Possibilities, Preferences and Choice. I did not know what he was talking about. He always wasted lots of time drawing graphs apart from reading ppt but ppt all had these diagrams.<br /><br />Be prepared to self-study all the stuff and ask friends if you have questions.

While final I got 97/100.<br /><br />overall percentage is 90% and I got an A. Even though I got the highest in the final, I performed badly in the mid-term so an A should be fine for me. Friendly reminder for anyone who seeks to achieve A range, try to do all the practice problems before mid-term and final, as they are super useful and can help you to clarify some concepts that you thought u knew well but u don&#039;t. It might look extremely hard the first time you do them, but that&#039;s normal cuz they are designed to be like this. Just read the answer and try to understand the concept behind them when you don&#039;t know how to do it.",

For those who want to ditch classes (like me) but don&#039;t want to miss any pop-up quizzes, Tang usually will have the quizzes arranged 2-3 lectures before mid-term and final. Try not to miss those lectures or you will regret losing 5% total grade. IMO, the tutorial is pretty useless and a waste of time attending them, as the TA is just reading PPT. You could learn more by reading the ppt alone and doing exercises. Despite the fact that TA is bad at teaching, he is nice and friendly. If you don&#039;t look at his teaching, he is a 10/10 TA.",

Understanding everything in lecture is sufficient. Not all content in the lectures are covered by the practice problem sets, but some are indeed tested in the finals. Some extra review may still be needed even if all practice questions are done.",

I didn&#039;t skip any lectures because I don&#039;t pre-study, and sometimes his explanation is quite fast so reviewing is needed after the lectures.<br /><br />If you ask him anything beyond syllabus like rigorous proofs, he will give it to you right away.<br /><br />TA doesn&#039;t care about you at all. He probably just care about getting his work done. No idea what his paper checking session is for. Got every appeal request rejected with irrelevant reasons and some taunting.

You may read through other comments and find others saying this course is just like a review of what they have learnt and have a minimal workload, but I better recommend you to put very high effort and time in reviewing the notes before lesson and revise it, otherwise you will definitely gonna fail the course!

Some of them are quite challenging, but Professor Gong will tell us which parts will not be tested, so make sure to attend ALL lectures. <br />The list of chapters can be found in other reviews, so I&#039;m gonna skip that part.",

In most cases, Robin relies on his slides, but it is ok because the powerpoints are well-designed, clearly structured, and detailed, just revising by reading the PPT and doing some past paper will get you an A.<br /><br />Besides, he is helpful and patient. If you ask him questions after the lecture, he is more than willing to answer them for you with the most detailed explanation.

At the end of the semester, I think there&#039;re only 20 ppl left in the lecture. The good thing is when she starts teaching non-DSE stuff, she spends more time on explanation and graph sketching, which is quite useful.

I thought the midterm would be manageable, but then the time is quite tight and u have to do q very fast. Also, one question was like &quot;According to professor yu...&quot; and you have to answer the exact phrase she mentioned in class (5 marks!!). Lesson learnt from this midterm is that you should copy her lecture slides into your cheatsheet using the exact wording. After the midterm, we have more new stuff, and you may want to spend some time to understand the materials. Make sure u attend her classes (or skip the class and watch the video) and listen to her in-class examples. Her final exam question was exactly the same with what she said in class!! In the final exam, many answers were 爛數 :00 (non integer numbers) and you may want to double check to avoid minor calculation mistakes. <br /><br />Even if you didn&#039;t get a good score in the midterm, you still can get a good grade by doing well in the final!

However, there is still something different from the econ knowledge that you have learned in high school, for example, learning about the curve, I think it is the most difficult part.<br /><br />Beyond that, it is nothing to worry about, just be more hardworking on your tutorial exercise question and remember the ppt content.",

      "comment_teaching": "He is a chill and funny person because he always cracks some jokes during his lectures which I enjoy a lot. Also, he often relates economic concepts to his own experiences like he relates the diminishing marginal utility to his experience in being a soldier in South Korea which makes it more understandable. Moreover, he is willing to stay behind to answer questions for one hour because simply it&#039;s his office hour and he also encourages interactions on zoom which often encourages to just shout out to answer questions. I think it will be better to attend his lessons face to face. However, at the second half of the lectures, he had missed around&nbsp;&nbsp;three lectures due to his stomach problem and he was in hospital then. So later on he spoke a little but fast on the concepts. But it is manageable because he is very responsible that he uploads extra three zoom recording for us to watch so I can rewatch it many times. Moreover, he skipped teaching monopolistic competition but added some new things that other professors may not teach. For example, the Groves-Clarke Mechanism which is very special and interesting. Also, he teaches game theory the best because he is a game theorist and it is good for someone who wants to know more about game theory. So reg his course if you want to know more about game theory and he can definitely tell you more about that.",
      "comment_grading": "Attendance: 10%(this is a zoom-class and he requires all of us to open our cameras so as long as you attend all lessons, you will get that 10%) <br />Assignments: 15%(1st assignment: 138/140, mean: 131.3, high: 140 <br />2nd assignment: 236/245, mean:230.8, high:245<br />3rd assignment: 120/120, mean:111.1, high:120) <br />Midterm: 30%(100 minutes, me:153/200, mean: 124.7, high: 174)<br />Final: 45%(2 hours, all marks are unknown) <br />Final grade: A+ <br />I think the grading is lenient because he said he would give 25% top an A which it is unusual in ust. For the midterm, it is quite difficult because we are allowed to open book due to having some online exam for some not-in-hk people. It is about the taxi market in Hong Kong with some background information provided so it really tests your understanding. For the final exam, it is also open book because there are still some not-in-hk people. But I would say the final exam is testing your writing speed more than economic thinking because one long question is exactly the same with previous past paper question and the ta has talked about that question during tutorial. Another two long questions are true or false questions with 50 marks each and basically you have to write an essay explaining whether you agree with that statement or not and simply you can just copy the graphs and explanations from the book. The last long question is the standard hw problem question so it is not difficult at all. One reminder for you all is that he won&#039;t have MC in his exams because he said that he hates MC and all are long questions. So some who are good at MC should go to other classes.",

Ch.8, 9, and 15 have the most number of new concepts, and Ch. 12-13 have the most extensions. Since only students who have taken Economics will take ECON2113, it is a pretty simple course. Just be sure to expect little differences in question types, concepts, and other items. There are interesting discussion topics and scenarios.",

If you decide to not pay attention because you already know Economics, it is also not a good choice because you may miss some useful tips, so there is a dilemma. <br /><br />There is a tutorial every week for one day that teaches the computational skills but the TA, Ms. Chen Kwan, tends to overcomplicate things and the skills are not useful in practice. She usually overruns as well.",
      "comment_grading": "Pretty disappointed at the large proportion the final exam takes up given the formidable difficulty. Very risky class to take even if you only want a decent grade. You may be fine if you are an elite.<br />There are 5 online MC quizzes with 20 questions per quiz (actually 6 in total but the first one is not counted towards the final score). Each is 8%. Open-book but there is a very bad system that you must make a choice before proceeding to the next question. You cannot return to the previous question after confirming your answer as well.<br />There are 7 Problem sets in total and the 6 with the highest scores will be counted towards the final score. You already get full marks if you finish them and submit them on time. They take up 9% of the grand total.<br />The final exam is NOTHING LIKE the usual questions! Extremely complicated and advanced compared to the exercises and assignments. Even if you do well in usual quizzes, be prepared for incredibly hard computational questions. Here are the statistics:<br />Average\t52.1/120<br />Median\t48.8/120<br />STDEV\t19.8<br />As you can see, the mean and median are both under 50% of the score. The lowest score is 13/120.<br />Ms. Ding has a fair policy of calculating our final score by shifting more of the weight to the exam or the quizzes according to the method that gives students the higher score out of the two. Details can be found on page 3 in the attached document.",

In the beginning, he had already designed the cut-off BEFORE our mid-term: 85%- A range, 70%- B range... After all, he obviously overestimated us!!! I think he lowered the cut-off at last without telling us and directly released the letter grade. I get an A- with about 82% marks eventually.",

And he is like immersing himself into explaining some economic concepts, whether they are basic or advanced. <br /><br />If you are a GPA/exam-oriented person, please just directly skip most of his lessons, except for the lesson before the mid-term exam and the lesson before the final exam. And what you should do more is trying to view and understand all the content in the textbook, then ask Robin any concepts/questions you can&#039;t grasp/solve via Gmail. He will usually reply to your email within 3 to 4 hours. That the crux of how you understand what Robin tries to teach in lessons.<br /><br />Another tip is that you may directly learn the content of this course by navigating other uni websites. There are scores of free online resources. You may ask Robin any questions about the problem sets that appeared in those free online uni courses. <br /><br />By the way, please skip tutorials. They are useless at all, except for the summary notes that you can review any concepts quickly in them.",

What he does in lectures is basically reading out the slides. (Robin, if you&#039;re seeing this review, please do try to explain more about the fundamental concepts given in the slides first, but not reading out the slides directly...). What is more important is that he should cover more exam-related contents in class because he can&#039;t just ask something alien all of a sudden in exams!<br /><br />The tutor, Astor, is very, very, very disastrous. She&#039;s even worse than the professor...<br />Maybe she&#039;s nice in person, I&#039;ll never know because of the online mode, but she&#039;s horrible when it comes to teaching: she goes through over-simplistic question types from her so-called &#039;notes&#039; which even high school students could accomplish and is not useful to us (her notes are all DIRECT copy and pastes from lecture notes, which are of no use at all. Why don&#039;t I read the lecture slides then?). <br />Worse still, I can&#039;t stand the fact that she spent so much time on unnecessary contents, e.g. how to use camscanner, over-elaborating midterm guidelines page by page...

I got 64, which is still far away from the highest score 8X.<br /><br />I think Robin knows what&#039;s going on and decided to grace us with a final of lower difficulty (still hard, but you will know how to do each question if you revise). Otherwise, I&#039;m sure all of my classmates will fuck up and get at most a C.<br /><br />Tips for you if you got enrolled in his course:<br />Read every page of lecture slides and revise all of them EVEN IF HE DIDN&#039;T MENTION IT. For instance, he asked about a unitary elastic curve that passes through origin in 2020 midterm. Actually, supply that passes through origin has Es of 1, and this is quite tricky because it appears in lecture slides and many people neglect it, thinking that they already know all about elasticity from DSE.",

      "comment_content": "The course is quite easy in the beginning, especially for DSE students. Content for the first few lessons includes basic trade theory (DSE macro stuff), demand and supply, basic concepts etc.. Things get a bit tougher after that, chapters such as utility and indifference curve are completely new to DSE students. Also, note that this course involves a lot of basic calculation when solving problems in assignments and tests (e.g. calculate equilibrium price and quantity with equations of the demand and supply curve), so the question types are quite different from DSE. I do think that it is useful for students that are going to choose econ related majors and provide sufficient basic insight to the microeconomics field.<br />Lecture content are as follows:<br />Chapter 1: What is Economics?<br />Chapter 2: The Economic Problem<br />Part 2: How Markets Work<br />Chapter 3: Demand and Supply (1); Demand and Supply (2)<br />Chapter 4: Elasticity (1)<br />Chapter 4: Elasticity (2)<br />Chapter 5: Efficiency and Equity<br />Chapter 6: Government Actions in Markets<br />Chapter 7: Global Markets in Action (1)<br />Chapter 7: Global Markets in Action (2)<br />Part 3: Households’ Choices<br />Chapter 8: Utility and Demand<br />Midterm Exam covers Chapter 1 through 8 <br />Part 4: Firms and Markets<br />Chapter 9: Possibilities, Preferences, and Choice<br />Chapter 11: Output and Costs (1)<br />Chapter 11: Output and Costs (2)<br />Chapter 12: Perfect Competition<br />Chapter 13: Monopoly<br />Chapter 14: Monopolistic Competition<br />Chapter 15: Oligopoly<br />Part 5: Market Failure and Government<br />Chapter 17: Externalities<br />Part 6: Factor Markets, Inequality, and Uncertainty<br />Chapter 18: Markets for Factors of Production<br />Chapter 19: Economic Inequality<br />Chapter 20: Uncertainty and Information<br />Final exam covers all the topics taught.",

Be prepare for interactions during class.<br /><br />His teaching materials are okay. Just the teaching slides are a bit long and the info are scattered, but does not affect much. He teaches according to the slides so skipping lessons won&#039;t affect much. You can always revise by the slides. The assignments are basically practice for mid-term and exam. Overall speaking, he is a very good professor and so far my favourite one.",

So if you know how to nail the assignments you will nail the exams. <br /><br /><br />Prof. Lim Woo Young is a rather casual professor, attendance accounts for only 5%, does not matter much. Just make the professor remember you by asking questions and you will get the 5%.<br /><br />I got 5* in DSE, studied around 6 hours for mid-term and 10 hours for final, finished all assignments.

      "comment_teaching": "First of all, Prof. Ding doesn&#039;t take attendance. In the first lecture, she already said: &quot;attending my lesson or not is your freedom, but I won&#039;t provide any make-up sessions because you are responsible for attending the lessons on time&quot;.<br /><br />To be frank, Prof. Ding&#039;s teaching is a bit boring. Basically, she directly reads through the lecture notes, which are the powerpoints of the textbooks with maybe some modification made by her. On the other hand, she opts to ask questions frequently. In her lecture notes, there are some MCQs for clarifying concepts, and she may ask the questions through iPRS.<br /><br />Prof. Ding cares a lot about &quot;concepts&quot;. She always asks us to explain certain concepts in a way that &quot;your grandparents would understand&quot;. She tries to use many examples so that students can master the skills, not in a way of memorizing but really understanding it. Sometimes the concepts are very different from the DSE syllabus and you may not be able to digest them within a short time.<br /><br />There is also a tutorial session once per week. I personally think that our TA Peter is quite good. Prof. Ding would ask Peter to explain some difficult concepts in lectures or teach us some mathematical skills that are useful in the course. Peter would give us a handout at the beginning of the tutorial. It contains some key concepts (with explanation) and some simple exercise. Peter would try to discuss and explain all the questions in the handout if possible. He welcomes students asking him questions, although sometimes we may not be able to really solve the problem.",
      "comment_grading": "In my opinion, Prof. Ding is one of the best professors in terms of grading. First, she mentioned in the first lecture that she would give out as many A&#039;s and B&#039;s as possible (like 15-20% A&#039;s or even more). Besides, she provides 2 grading schemes so that students may still have a chance to get a good grade if they unfortunately missed some quizzes or performed poorly in some quizzes. <br /><br />Components counting towards final grade:<br />Problems Sets, Online Quizzes and Final Exam (will be explained in detail below and in &quot;workload&quot; part)<br /><br />Scheme 1 <br />Problem Sets 9% (1.5%@, counts 6 out of 7)<br />Canvas Online Quizzes 40% (8%@, 5 in total)<br />Final Exam 51%<br /><br />Scheme 2 <br />Problem Sets 9% (1.5%@, counts 6 out of 7)<br />Canvas Online Quizzes 24% (8%@, best 3 out of 5)<br />Final Exam 67%<br /><br />Obviously Prof. Ding provides 2 schemes so that students will not be drastically worse off if they performed poorly in either one of the components.<br /><br />My results: (My final percentage is nearly the same under the two schemes so I use scheme 1 for more information)<br /><br />Problem Sets 9% (full marks, in which everyone do get)<br />Online Canvas Quizzes 33.6%<br />Quiz 1 (Ch. 3-4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17/20, mean 16.5 <br />Quiz 2 (Ch. 5-6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19/20, mean 17.2<br />Quiz 3 (Ch. 7-8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18/20, mean 14.4<br />Quiz 4 (Ch. 10-11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15/20, mean 16.5<br />Quiz 5 (Ch. 12-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15/20, mean 15.1<br /><br />Final Exam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.6%<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(75.77/100, mean 51.5, SD 14.74)<br />(*this year&#039;s situation was different from the past, please refer to the &quot;workload&quot; part)<br />Total percentage under scheme 1: around 81.2%<br />Final letter grade: A<br /><br />The highest mark in the final exam was 88.5%, which was one SD higher than my score. Besides, I didn&#039;t perform as well as the others in the quizzes because the highest mark for all the quizzes were full mark. However, I still managed to get an A, which was out of my expectation. I would roughly estimate that Prof. Ding has at least given 20% student an A range, which is very generous.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is very light, or even 0 in my opinion. Apart from the lectures and the tutorials, all you need to do is a few problem sets, which contains MCQs and short/long questions related to the latest chapters taught. The &quot;exciting&quot; point is that Prof. Ding said she won&#039;t check the answers of your submission, i.e. as long as you upload something, marks will be awarded.<br /><br />The online quizzes are also not as stressful as mid-term exams, because each quiz only contains 20 MCQs, in which you need to finish it within 30 minutes. Each quiz only covers 2 chapters, so you don&#039;t need to always keep revising.<br /><br />*Special Arrangement for Final Exam this year<br />The final exam was changed to an online format regarding the fact that the school campus was closed and all in-campus lectures were canceled since early November. <br />The final exam was 130 marks in total, which consists of 20 MCQs (2 marks@each question, 40 in total) and 7 short or long questions (ranging from 8-21 marks each). The exam length was 100 minutes.<br />Although it was called an &quot;online exam&quot;, only the MCQs and first 3 short questions were genuinely online. For the remaining 4 long questions, we needed to write all the answers in a piece of paper, then take a photo of the answer sheet with your student ID card, finally upload the .jpg (only .jpg is accepted) in Canvas.<br />To be honest, I think that the time allowed was not sufficient in the final exam. For example, we needed to finish an 8-12 mark short question within 5 minutes (including time for uploading the image).

Thinking like an economists (sounds weird but basically, you are doing this in IAL econ)<br />2. Specialisation and trade <br />3. Demand and Supply<br />4. Elasticity<br />5. Efficiency and Equity <br />6. Government meets Market<br />8. Utility and demand<br />9. Possibilities, Preferences and Choices <br />10. Organizing Production<br />11. Output and costs <br />12.

      "comment_teaching": "I genuinely believe the professor teaches very well, you may think that because you have learnt most of the content in the module (if you studied the same IAL modules as I did) you don&#039;t have to go to lectures but I recommend you do go to the lectures as <br />1. she skims through a lot of content as she does understand that people enrolled in this course have pretty good economic knowledge but does so according to DSE economics, not IAL economics so you won&#039;t be bored listening to stuff you already know<br />2. most chapters have some additional content that is taught which are the ones she goes through thoroughly and I felt that the graphs were understood when explained<br /> 3. she gives a lot of good examples and is willing to discuss with students <br />4. her lectures are actually really enjoyable as I feel like it had a really good balance between teaching course content, in-class iPRS exercises, discussions and most importantly she speaks close to perfect English without much of an accent<br />5. her slides on canvas are not the same as the slides used in class, the difference being that there are no answers to questions and some blanks that she wants you to fill in in class. But she does upload the complete version on the canvas for final revision.<br /><br />NB the tutorials had some revision of content from lecture and sometimes new information or application of knowledge. Should go through as although the things taught in the tutorials do show up in the final.",

This also makes lecture EXTREMELY BORING as we need to waste time listening to his hesitation and shuttering.<br /><br />He also like to upload the PowerPoint right before the lecture (5 minutes before lecture start......) so self-study is not possible either.<br /><br /><br /><br />The tutor, however, knows the relationship between different concepts very well, and can tell the main points of 3-4 chapters precisely in just a 50 minute tutorial session.<br /><br />Homework solutions are discussed in tutorial sessions. However professors don&#039;t upload and don&#039;t allow us to look at the solution (what a stupid idea) and you need to take pictures quickly by your phone.

Topics like PPF, demand and supply, elasticity, government intervention and externality are not difficult to understand. Later, perplexing stuff like budget line, indifference curve, perfect competition, monopoly, and game theory will be introduced. You need to understand the logic behind thoroughly thereafter because reciting everything won&#039;t help anymore.",
      "comment_teaching": "Ding Fei&#039;s lecture is as boring as hell. You have to really pay attention to what she is talking about lest you can&#039;t resist but fall into sleep. In terms of the lecture materials, I would say they are not well-designed because they are too brief. Even the iPRS problems are far too simple compared to those in quizzes and final exam! To fully understand the concepts taught in lecture, you must carefully read through the textbook and make some notes on that. <br /><br />My tutor is Jason Cheung, a fresh graduate from HKUST Economics. Attending his tutorial is far more effective than going to lecture. You can either listen to an organised summary of the topic or clarify your confusions by addressing to him face-to-face.",

Even though I got 18/20 for most quizzes thereafter, eventually I could only get the total quiz result close to the mean score. For the final exam, the TAs marked the paper more vigorously than I expect. Even if you express the same meaning but without the key words they want, you would end up losing some points or even get a 0 score!!! My result of final exam was slightly lower than my expectation because of that. I am a little bit disappointed for not getting a B+ (I guess a ~80% is needed for a B+). Though, learning Economics is great!",
      "comment_workload": "This is only an introductory Economics course without vigorous Maths proofs. Only graphical illustrations and simple Maths representations are required. Without perplexing Maths (like multivariable calculus, econometrics......), workload should not be huge -- even people not sensitive to figures (who flunked out in Accounting course like me) should perform satisfactorily in this course. What you need to do before final exam is to summarize all graphs and concepts once, then try to express in words the logic behind and see how concepts and topics could be connected together. Don&#039;t forget to review the quizzes and the practice problems provided on Canvas as well.",

Therefore, if you can deal with the homework by yourself then the midterm and the exam would be a piece of cake.<br /><br />Finally i got A in this course with both midterm and final above 2 sd.

Maybe this is my problem. Believe it or not, he explained every topic for a long time but I personally do not think he elaborate them in a clear way. <br /><br />Also, I do not think he is a person with passion in teaching and helping you. He provided his own-created practice questions for you as homework. However, he will only post the answer to canvas a week or so before the exam. Moreover, his answers which are created by him again are so simple that it could be fewer than ten words for a question with more than 30 marks. It made me so confusing and could not catch up with what he really wanted us to answer. When my friends and I tried to ask him for more detailed answer key, he just answered that he saw no point in doing it and eventually ignored our request.<br /><br />Sorry for those who love Professor Lim a not, but&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do not have much good impression about him.

The paper should be set more difficult.<br /><br />I get 95% finally (95.7% also A). I have heard that cut-off for A+ is 96%. From UST FYS Secret, I hear that some students get B-range for &gt;90% (not completely assured).<br /><br />During the class, she would invite students to come out and perform activities that facilitate her teaching.

He usually covers useful mathematical approaches for solving problems in tutorials, which the problems will appear in the exams.

Before midterms and final exam, she will give us some in-class exercise and MC questions which are generally easy and help us prepare for exam. Sometimes at the beginning of lectures she will share some videos which are quite funny. The TA guy will give us some exercises in tutorials but he is rushing everything super fast !!!

The exam questions are very different from DSE one and at first it seems difficult as you are not familiar with the question type. However basically if you understand all the concepts thoroughly, attend all the lectures and tutorials and do the self-practices and problem sets, you will be doing fine in exam. Good grade comes with hard work. You can also earn some extra credits if you answer questions in lecture.",

Therefore, I think this course has no actual use, apart from helping students fulfill their requirements.",

When the lecturer literally has to bribe the students to answer questions, it is obvious that the lecturer lacks ability to interact with students.<br /><br />With regards to actual content, the lecturer is content with just reading from the powerpoint files that are on canvas. The only saving grace is that the lecturer explains how to do problems quite well.",
