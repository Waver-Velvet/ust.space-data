    "name": "Introduction to Networked Sensing, Estimation and Control",
    "description": "The course gives an introduction to the analysis and design of sensing, estimation and control systems in a networked setting. It consists of three parts: the first part introduces necessary background knowledge in communication networks, sensor networks, linear state estimation, MAP and ML estimators, Kalman filtering, and modern control theory; the second part focuses on analysis of network effect to remote state estimation and control; the third part presents some advanced topics including distributed state estimation and resource allocation through scheduling.",

      "comment_content": "The course is about the state-space model and Kalman filter. It is very useful. The theory of the Kalman filter will be explained from different views. And I think you don&#039;t have to know much about control theory before the course.",
