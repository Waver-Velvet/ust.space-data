    "description": "Properties of MOSFET are a strong function of its width and length due to short-channel effects. Even two MOSFETs with the same width and the same length, their properties are not identical due to process variations and various non-ideal effects such as layout dependent effects (LDEs) and parasitic elements in CMOS technology. In this course, students will learn about how the above-\u0002mentioned effects affect analog circuit performance, and what kinds of methodologies can be used to minimize their impacts.",
