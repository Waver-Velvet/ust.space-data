The professor even shows some current research approaches, which is interesting. However, this course only brings very basic knowledge to the area of robotics, many important topics such as ROS are touched only on a superficial level. That said, take this course if you want to have an introduction into (mobile) robotics, but don&#039;t expect to much.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teacher is a nice guy and has a great empathy with students regarding the grading, assignments, project etc. He also tries to not spend too much time on maths, though some of them are important.<br /><br />However, his teaching style is not the greatest. The slides/his explanations are often unclear, he sometimes misses understanding of the topics himself (especially the math part). Luckily, he shows many external ressources for the topics, e.g. YouTube videos from another professor on that topic, that increase understanding drastically. This comes at a cost of further workload however.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is very fair. The teacher wants to have most students in the A/B range and will try to let most of the students pass. Grading scheme is tentative and can change drastically from semester to semester. In our case, the grading scheme is not completely fix yet. Most certainly, the grade will depend on the following factors:<br /><br />- in-class quizzes (which are rather hard)<br />- assignments (which are rather easy)<br />- 3 projects in C++ (which are hard in the beginning, but you get used to it)",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is light because there are no midterm/final exams. However, the projects take much time because C++ is hard to develop and debug. All in all, it is still lighter workload than most other subjects.",

      "comment_teaching": "Wang Lujia, a young and good looking research assistant professor in ECE. She&#039;s indeed a nice person, and is willing to answer questions after class. <br /><br />But I think this woman should never be allowed to teach classes again!<br /><br />I&#039;ve written more than a dozen reviews on Ustspace and this is the first time I give such low rating to any course. I am a year 3 student already, and believe me, I&#039;ve encountered bad teaching many times, but I&#039;ve never seen teaching that is THIS BAD!<br /><br />1. Lujia literally doesn&#039;t know how to speak English.<br />Let aside the accecnt, which is at least tolerable and understandable, she doesn&#039;t even know how to procounce certain words and terminologies. What&#039;s more ridiculous is that some times she just skims over the things that she doesn&#039;t know how to pronounce and move on. For example: &quot;So here, we can see that the &amp;^%$^$*^@$% has increased, right?&quot;. I mean like WTF???? she literally just uses gibberish to replace that part and end the sentence with &quot;right?&quot;. What on earth do you think us students are?<br /><br />2. She is unable to answer questions in a reasonable way.<br />Many times, when students ask her questions, the answer she provided is simply not related to what the student has asked. And this happened many times throughout the semester both in class and after class. At first I thought it&#039;s because her poor English skill that she didn&#039;t understand the question which was raised in English during class. But later on, when I speak with her using Mandarine after class, I relaized that language can&#039;t be the problem. She is intentionally avoiding to answer your question directly either because she didn&#039;t prepare well enough for the materials that she doesn&#039;t know the answer either, or she simply want to easily get rid of your questions by saying something irrelevant so that the students feel confused and embarrassed and will leave on their own.<br /><br />I studied this course purly relying on Youtube by searching for relavent tutorial videos according to the keyword Syllabus. Her teaching was completely useless. Moreover, this class was 9 a.m. in the morning. So this makes me even more angry that I have to wake up before 9 a.m. just to waste 80 mins of my life to listen to her rubbish lecture simply because I&#039;m affraid I will miss a quiz (which is just attendance taking exeucuted in another way). And it turns out that the quiz was a huge differentiaor, which is something even more ridiculous considering that this is a 3000 level engineering course instead of LANG or SBM course.<br /><br />The TAs were good though. Actually I really feel sorry for those TAs that they were to some extent bullied by Lujia (I think). Lujia made them teach 3 lessons throughout the semester, which is something very uncommon here in hkust (making TAs teach lectures). But to be honest, the TAs&#039; teaching were way more helpful than Lujia&#039;s lectures except that the TA&#039;s voice was a bit too small. And the TAs responded emails quite fast and they were also pretty helpful in terms of the homework and projects.",
      "comment_grading": "I don&#039;t know how much A range was given. But the grading scheme was just ridiculous!<br /><br />3 Homework 40%<br />1 Midterm Exam 25%<br />1 Final Robotic Challenge 20%<br />5 mini-quizzes 15%<br /><br />For the homework, most students get nearly full. This is normal and expected. For the midterm, the difference between the high and low is not too large, but considering there are only 30 students in total, the distribution was acceptable as well.<br /><br />The robotic challenge (project) and the quiz were just ridiculous. <br /><br />First for the robotic challenge (project). Originally, the ddl is set at Dec 5th, then it was postponed to Dec 10th because many students said they were very busy during the final period. This annoucement was made on Nov 25th, which is more than a week before the original ddl. At this point it seems very reasonable and I really appreciated the leniency that the teaching team provided. We were in deed very busy during the final exam period and the announcement was made early enough to allow us to make proper time planning. <br />But then, at Dec 10, 11:35 P.M., which is LESS THAN 30 MINUTES before the ddl, the TA made an announcemnt to postpone the ddl even further till Dec 15th. The reason was that some groups were experiencing &quot;Technical Issues&quot; such that &quot;Some students are having trouble submitting their codes and uploading their videos.&quot;. HOW CAN YOU SIMPLY POSTPONE THE DDL LESS THAN 30 MINUTES BEFORE THE ORIGINAL DDL??? WHAT KIND OF IRRESPOSIBLE DECISION IS THIS? One course mate of mine stayed up two full nights to finish the project because he was also very busy with many other issues during the period. We work hard to meet the aggreed ddl, then you just simply postpone it 20 min before the ddl? How do you expect the students who worked so hard to meet the previous deadline accept it? How is this fair? What kind of &quot;Technical issue&quot; needs 5 days to fix? If it&#039;s just submission technical issues then why not just make a submission via email? &quot;Technical issue&quot; should not be an excuse to postpone the ddl for 5 days! This was very irresponsible and unfair to other students!<br /><br />And now to the mini-quizes. Originally they announced that there will be 5 of them, but in the end only three were released and each quiz worth 5% of the total grade. This is the most ridiculous part of the grading schems. For each quiz, it&#039;s just 3 MC question released right after the lecture during class, and we are expected to finish it and submit before the class ended. <br />(1). It&#039;s not reasonable to assess the understanding of students right after the materials were covered. We didn&#039;t even had the chance to clarify any confusions especially when the instructor&#039;s teaching was a disaster (see teaching section).<br />(2). It&#039;s not reasonable to put so much weight on a quiz that simply have 3 MC questions. This means one MC question directly accounts for more than 1% in the final grade with in total 9 questions throughout the semester to account for 15% of the overall grade (And this later became a huge differentiator among students, see last part in Grading section). This grade weighting is just outrageous!<br />(3). This is not a quiz. This is attendance taking executed in another way! She randomly choose some lectures to relase the quiz in class. Hence we had to attend every class or else we risk loosing directly 5% out of the total score. Probably she knows that her teaching is terrible that if she doesn&#039;t put attendance as a part of the grading scheme, no one will show up during the class. Anyway, this meant that for a 3000 level engineering course, attendance accounts for 15% of the final grade !? This is way too ridiculous.<br /><br />As for the overall grading in terms of giving the letter grade:<br />(1). Homework does not differentiate students.<br />(2). The midterm could differentiate students to some extent. But the discriminatIve power is lower than it&#039;s supposed to be. (The questions were a bit too easy)<br />(3). The project could have been a major differentiator, but because the irresponsible decision of postponeing the ddl, again almost everyone got nearly full. Hence the project does not differentiate students either.<br />(4). The &quot;quiz&quot;, which is essentially attendace taking, had a way huger discriminative power than it&#039;s supposed to have. One of my friends who took this course together with me got almost identical grades in all parts except for the quiz. (He was 1.8% lower than me overall if we don&#039;t count the quiz. But for the quiz, I got 7/9 while he got 5/9, and this 2-point-difference caused him to lose an extra 3.33% in the final grade. And he lost this 2% because he was under quarantine due to Covid when the first quiz was released during class. That&#039;s why he missed the first quiz. And the consequences were devastating. Simply because the 2 points in the mini-quizzes, he got B+ while I got A+). Atttached you may find the statistics and grades of 4 students from this class for your reference. Again, this is the most ridiculous and unfair grading scheme I have ever seen in HKUST.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is pretty small except for the project. The largest workload comes from waking up at 9 A.M. to attend the useless lectures just in case there&#039;s a quiz. <br /><br />You do need to watch quite a lot Youtube videos to finish the homework since the lectures are completly useless. Each Homework should take around one day if you take the &quot;self-learning&quot; process into account.<br /><br />The project can take quite a lot of time. For my group, Both of us spent around 3 full days doing self studying and research to finsh all the coding and testing.
