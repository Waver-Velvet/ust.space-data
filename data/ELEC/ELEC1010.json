But I have to remind you that, the students majoring in ELEC can still enroll this course and they may have a big advantage in this course (for my friend, he didn’t attend the lecture/ have review on slides, and ends up with a mean in midterm).<br /><br />Beside! Please have a look here, this year, the exam paper is much similar to the 2021 one (80+%) + sample paper (10+%), only 2/3 questions may be out of the range, if you have resources, then you at least can obtain a B+ ~ A- if you have done the pp, since my friend, who didn’t attend any lecture and tutorials and he only memorised all pp ans and steps, then he obtained 25+ for each exams, for others, who I know, attended the lectures and reviewed the slides and note only, can only attain mean (what the hell the mean is so high)<br /><br />Ok the marking scheme here:<br />HW 10% (Assignment score sum together is 100, you can over 10 directly to obtain the score)<br />Midterm 35% (Your score/30 x 35% x 100)<br />Final 55% (Your score/35 x 55% x 100)<br />Optional project, if you obtain 8/10 or above you can boost one more sub-grade, have to remind you, for this year, UQ is 6 :D )<br /><br />Why I give E here is because this course doesn’t really test your knowledge on this course, but how the relationship between you and seniors connected, because the source can save you life, but unfortunately, I don’t have :) and my friend just show off in front of me after the exams, which make me feel disgusting with this course’s grading materials and I want to disclose it.<br />( I don’t mean that you cannot obtain a good grade in which you don’t have resources, but the resource can give you a big big big advantage as you at least will have ideas on what’s the real part you should review)<br /><br />Update：<br />Overall higher than mean for a bit bit bit, resulted in B-, the grading may be a bit better than other engineering/science common course.",

I&#039;d like to particularly make some comments on the lecture notes.<br /><br />The organization and structure of the course materials are a bit chaotic. For example, there are 3 topics A, B, and C. The arrangement could be like A+B (intro, but ambiguous) C (detailed) A (repeated) B (clarified) A+B (repeated) A (repeated) A (detailed) . Yes, proper times of repetition help students enhance their memory, but in the case of this course: <br />1. The same topic is scattered across different chapters, and the intervals between them can be quite distant. <br />2. The level of detail regarding a particular topic does not consistently increase or decrease, but rather fluctuates irregularly.<br />3. Some important topics suddenly appear without being defined (e.g., SNR_dB, only stated in the &quot;Formulae that will be provided in the exam&quot;), while others are abruptly cut off without further elaboration.",

(If I remember correctly, another reminder regarding the consequences of not filling in the version on the MC sheet is phrased in a different and clear manner such that this one looks totally the opposite)<br /><br /><br />Given the relatively straightforward nature of this course, the exams are likely to include highly specific and factual questions. These questions will play a significant role in determining whether you achieve an acceptable or satisfactory grade. However, it is important to note that your comprehension of the concepts will determine the baseline of your overall score.<br /><br />Me and my friend:<br />- mid 28/30 + final 31/35 + only lost few marks in hw + no project bonus -&gt; A<br />- mid 27/30 + final 33/35 + the same -&gt; A+<br />(and you can refer to postexamples&#039;s review below, whose scores are very close to us)",

Our groups summarize a topic into a PPT, with appropriate math formulae and illustrations (but no pretty design, don&#039;t know if it matters), but result in a low score. <br /><br />Again, though the content is straightforward, it is expected that you invest more time in digesting the material (as opposed to the knowledge) itself. (Disclaimer: I think the pace of the live lectures is too slow, and the prof sometimes includes supplementary but less significant information so I skipped them. I&#039;m unsure if attending the lectures would be more efficient in terms of learning.)<br /><br />So I&#039;d like to give it a B (maybe between B and A)",

Nevertheless, due to this course&#039;s popularity, you probably can only enrol this course in your senior year.

If your group get 8/10 or above, your final grade will be one sub-grade up. I didn&#039;t do the optional project but seems many students said it&#039;s difficult to get 8/10 or above.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Tl;dr: If you are good at high school Maths and Physics, you can have a good grade with little effort. Otherwise, go find another course.<br /><br />From the grading scheme, you can notice that this course&#039;s grading heavily depends on your exam performance. Both midterm and final exam are MC questions on Canvas. Once you have answered a question, you can&#039;t go back.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are required to turn on the camera on your phone to clearly see your face, your hand, and your computer&#039;s monitor to prevent cheating. You have 50 minutes to answer 30 MC questions in the midterm exam; and 35 questions in the final. The time is limited and you can&#039;t double-check your answers. <br /><br />If you want to take this course since it is one of the &quot;good grade courses&quot;, then you have to consider the following questions:<br />- Are you already familiar with some of the topics covered in this course? For example, you are a EE/ CPEG student, or you have learnt Physics in high school.<br />- Are you good at Maths/ Physics so that you can calculate your answer quickly and accurately in the exam? <br /><br />If both of your answers are &quot;No&quot;, you&#039;d better choose another course to fulfil your common core requirement. I am neither familiar with the course topics nor good at Maths and Physics. I got a bad result in both exams so my grade sucks too. That&#039;s fair, but I&#039;d rather take another course.",

Most homework problems are taught in tutorials so make sure to check the tutorial notes. <br />I&#039;m not sure about the workload of the project.<br />There is no attendance. <br /> <br />However, you need to spend extra time to revise the material before the exam if it is the first time you encounter these topics.

Because the school can&#039;t have like 50 ELEC students getting full marks, they decided to make the exam a time-attack. Especially for the mid term exams, there were like 17pages of questions in a 50 min exam. I got really nervous due to the overwhelming amount of questions and ended up making stupid mistakes. For example, there&#039;s a lot of trick questions such as having bits and bytes mixed up (one question might have Kb and another might have KB). I guess it was their way of preventing full marks but it&#039;s really not an exam to test what you learned. It&#039;s just an exam to distribute students to a smooth bell curve.<br /><br />There is an optional project you can do to receive extra grade (from A- to A, c+ to b-). However the professor told us that it&#039;s gonna be quite competitive to get that extra grade. I didn&#039;t do it because I don&#039;t it&#039;s worth the effort and time.",

Some questions are conceptual. Going through the past final exam paper once will help, as some MCQs are similar to those in the past paper. If you have enough time, read the lecture notes (especially chapter 5 &amp; 6) as well. The short questions are quite challenging. (I scored 58/58 in MCQs and 58.5/72 in short questions.

Study for the midterm and final is much more meaningful.<br /><br />Whether the grading is good really depends on your background and expectation. There would normally be three outcomes:<br /><br />i) If you are an EE student (or MAE), the grading is very GOOD because you should be familiar with most of the content. You can easily score high marks with little effort. There are also many business students whom you can really shit on in the course.<br /><br />ii) If you have no pre-requisite knowledge and only expect a fair grading (B-range or A-) with a fair amount of effort, the grading is kind of good to you. The content itself is not hard to understand, and the B-range of this course is also wide.<br /><br />iii) If you have no pre-requisite knowledge and expect a good grade (A or above) from this course, then the grading is BAD to you. I am sure that it is almost impossible for you to beat the year 4 engineering students in the exams due to very limited time. Of course if you are a genius then you can ignore this.<br /><br />P.S.

      "comment_grading": "For my particular case, I did not score high enough on my optional project. But there is a tip I could share from reading ppts of those who scored high:<br />Detail is key. If you are from SBM, try not to use the business mindset that you have to make it pretty or something. Instead, try to fill in as much information as you can since the professor will only be reading your PPT and you need to make sure you show that you have a good understanding of the topic.<br /><br />Can&#039;t necessarily remember my mark. But I was above 0.85 sd in midterm. Got around 95% for my assignment.<br /><br />Final Grade : A",

The principle is the same.<br /><br />For both midterm and final. I just started studying the night before as both of them are heavily dependent on doing calculations. If you know how to do it, you are good to go.<br /><br />For the finals, however, I would advise you to go over the concepts taught in class as they will appear in some of the MCs. That could be a crucial factor if you want to get a good grade. <br /><br />Speed is also important as well, while the questions might be easy. It is more about quantity than quality. Midterm has only around 50 mins, so you need to be quick. So is the final. Good Luck. :)",

Final is cumulative, by mainly the material in chapters 4 to 6 will be tested. <br />The content is easy to understand for everyone, so the science/ engineering students do not have much advantages in it, except they can take less time on revision if they have learnt the concept already.<br />The exams are intense in terms of the testing time. You will find it bit rush to finish the whole exam paper, so if you are prepared for answering fast and finish it on time, you are better than the majority of the course.",

Therefore, it is not likely for students to struggle in learning if they put effort. <br />There is no participation mark, and the lecture videos are provided, so it is up to you to attend the lecture or not. If you are exam-oriented, just attending tutorial maybe fine enough. The TA also responds fast via email.",

You and your partner are not necessarily science/ engineering students as the groups with high scores are from business school.<br />Exam is easy, you will have positive return if you revise. I got 1 score above the mean in midterm, and I got 1 SD above in final, I got an A- at last.",
