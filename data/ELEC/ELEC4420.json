Especially when he assumed that we knew everything.<br /><br />The ppt slides are simple, textbook will be more helpful. <br /><br />L1: CMOS Integrated circuits<br />L2: Analog IC chip process<br />L3: CMOS device models and basic amplifiers<br />L4: Frequency response <br />L5: Feedback<br />L6: Stability and compensation <br />L7: Two-stage OPAMP design<br />L8: Voltage reference <br />L9: Oscillators",
      "comment_teaching": "Razavi is the best teacher ever. You will learn from the book more than from lessons. Going to lecture is meaningless, maybe you want to find a place to take some rest, you can attend the lecture, ensure you can fall asleep in 15 mins",
      "comment_grading": "Idk how the grading works, cuz the ta only give you the mark, but never talk about which part you did wrong, you have to figure it out by yourself. But he gives high marks, I suppose. And the final project is quite straightforward, easy to get good grade.",
      "comment_workload": "5 assignment, midterm exam, individual final project<br /><br />The final project is easy if you finish all assignments<br />No need to revise for midterm exam, if you know the knowledge , then you will know how to do during the exam",
