      "comment_teaching": "Firstly, Prof. Wang is super clear and understandable, even though the course covers everything from stats to how the brain works to AI. Big plus, her English is on point, so you won&#039;t get lost in translation.<br /><br />Now, this course? It&#039;s like a marathon that starts with the basics of probability and takes you all the way through to the mind-bending world of neural networks and reinforcement learning. You&#039;ll even get a peek into Prof. Wang&#039;s own research, and let me tell you, her excitement about the topic is infectious.<br /><br />What&#039;s really cool is how she ties together math stuff, neuro science, and computer whiz-bangery. She&#039;s got this knack for making tricky things make sense, even if you&#039;re not a genius in all those fields (yet!).",
      "comment_grading": "homework (20%), <br />mid-term exam (30%) <br />final project (50%)<br /><br />HWs are easy and each one takes about 3 hours, 4 Assignments in total.<br />HW1, HW2: MATH problem(e.g. Probability, Stochastic Process)<br />HW3: open question about biology<br />HW4: programming(Matlab) questions<br /><br />Midterm is so similar to HW1 and HW2 that you don&#039;t need to worry once you&#039;ve understood these two HWs.<br /><br />HW1: 94/100<br />HW2: 95/100<br />HW3: 98/100<br />HW4: 98/100<br />MT: 95/100<br />Final Project: not disclosed<br /><br />Final grade: A+",
      "comment_workload": "Yo! If you&#039;re stressing about the workload for Prof. Wang&#039;s course, you can chill a bit. It&#039;s actually pretty doable. Seriously, each homework assignment is a one-night stand – you can knock it out in an evening.<br /><br />The midterm? It&#039;s like déjà vu if you&#039;ve done the homework. No need to burn the midnight oil cramming for it.<br /><br />Now, the final project sounds intense but it&#039;s not that bad. You could probably throw together a first draft of your results in a day. Give yourself a week to tweak things and polish up your report, and you&#039;re golden. Just a heads up, if you&#039;re into machine learning, you might want to play around with different models – more time experimenting could make your project shine.<br /><br />Prof. Wang isn&#039;t a fan of just throwing models at the problem without thinking. So, take your time to really dig into the data, pick a model that makes sense, and then explain your choice in your report. She&#039;s looking for that thought process, not just fancy number-crunching.<br /><br />All in all, you&#039;ll have enough time for everything without pulling all-nighters, especially if you stay curious and thoughtful about the work.",
