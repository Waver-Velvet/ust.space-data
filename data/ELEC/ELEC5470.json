      "comment_grading": "The home assignments are graded by a TA, very quickly and accurately. <br /><br />The midterm and final exams were graded by the professor. Professors grading strategy was very nitpicky and tedious, for the exam with 50 pts max, the mean was about 14 pts.",
      "comment_workload": "Very high. 5 assignments with ~13 exercises from the book per each, midterm, final and a project (which requires 5 pages report). <br /><br />The most problems (both for the midterm and for the final) were drawn from the book. So solving the assignments during a semester is essential. <br /><br />The final project requirements were extremely vague: we needed to &quot;apply the learned theory to&nbsp;&nbsp;important real life problem&quot;. No references examples or further explanations were given.",
