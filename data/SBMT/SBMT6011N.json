    "description": "AI has emerged as a transformative technology that is changing broad aspects of business, competition, product development, innovation, and the nature of work. Breakthroughs have been coming at ever increasing speeds, bringing both opportunities and challenges. How should corporations, businesses, and individuals respond and position themselves in this emerging environment? How can businesses leverage the power of AI to increase their product competitiveness? Tapping into the instructor’s direct personal experience with concrete case examples, students will gain an industry insider’s view that goes beyond theory to cover actionable guidelines, practical tips, and best practices (including identifying situations where theory may not work in practice). By examining the differing modes of product development in Silicon Valley and China, this course provides a new framework and approach for product innovation in the Age of AI.",
