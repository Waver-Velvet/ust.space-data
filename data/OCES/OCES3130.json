      "comment_teaching": "In this year, 2/3 of the course taught by Prof. LIU, including the microorganisms and ecosystem, Prof. WU put his focus on the marine animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them taught well,&nbsp;&nbsp;but WU&#039;s course is much worthy to attend. He is a very good lecturer who knows how to make the content interesting and easy to understand. LIU makes nice and clean powerpoint for his teaching too, however he is not a really good speaker and it is easy to lose your attention during his lecture.But never mind, you can get a good grade&nbsp;&nbsp;by watching his slides only ;)",

      "comment_workload": "There are only midterm and final exam for this course, the final conducted 10% more because of larger amount of content compared to midterm and the content tested in midterm will not be tested in the final. Both midterm and final conducted 30-40 MC questions, and 2-4 short essay question. There are no attendance requirement.( I skipped almost half of the lectures) , so the workload is quite low compared to other OCES courses",
