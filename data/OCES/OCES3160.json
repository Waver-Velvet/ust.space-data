      "comment_content": "The course outline pdf is enclosed in this comment.<br /><br />It is preferred if you studied biology in high school, as some terminologies are explained/learnt beforehand. It might be challenging for people with no prior biology knowledge, as some terminology aren&#039;t as concisely explained and is skimmed over quickly.<br /><br />The course dabs on several ecology topics but doesn&#039;t dive too deep into them. Each ecology topic is covered in one lecture note, with an average of 20-35 pages each. Hence, it wouldn&#039;t be too difficult for people new to ecology to understand. The only issue would be the mixing up of information between various topics.<br /><br />The knowledge that will be tested isn&#039;t cumulative, so you don&#039;t have to stress about revising the same stuff from mid-term. <br /><br />The course description failed to mention that it was made for Science Year 3 Students (or maybe I&#039;m just blind, oop-). This didn&#039;t impact me, as I handled the course pretty well.<br /><br />Please be reminded that my notes (enclosed in this comment) are just summaries of different topics based on my understanding. Some information might be excluded/not as detailed compared to the lecture notes as I&#039;ve already learnt or memorized beforehand. I hope it can help anyone whose studying this course :&gt;",

She even showed us her potted plants once, to serve as an example of the relevant topic. In addition, she&#039;s very open to students asking her questions during lectures.",
      "comment_grading": "The exams are MC-based. They test your memorization (90%) and understanding (10%) of each topic. Most questions come from the lecture slides (not those you have to take pictures of). You don&#039;t have to remember everything word for word, as the answers don&#039;t differ much. If you aim high, you&#039;ll have to remember specific numbers and animals from each category, which appeared in several questions. Don&#039;t worry about forgetting specific mathematical models/formulas, they will be provided in exams without further explanation, so you&#039;ll still need to know what the alphabetical letters represent.<br /><br />The most challenging part is questions that test your understanding. Some are hinted at in lecture notes, so you have to pay close attention to detail. In mid-term, I struggled with 5 of those questions, while for my finals, I struggled with 7.<br /><br />Mid-term: 42/50 (50%)<br />Mean:36.1; Low:20.0; High 46.0<br />I started revising early on since the professor was uncertain about testing us with MCs and short questions. Also, I was never good at biology, so I was worried about not catching up.<br /><br />Finals: Not given (50%)<br />I started revising only a week before the exam. hence I didn&#039;t remember/understand as much during the finals.<br /><br />Overall, I got an A-.",
