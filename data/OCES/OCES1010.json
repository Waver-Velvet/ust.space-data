      "comment_content": "In my personal opinion, the content of OCES 1010 is like a combination of some basic knowledge of biology, chemistry, and geography, which might benefit students in Science B as it is really fundamental. It is not worth advanced learning or even putting so much time and effort into learning; as long as you listen to what the lecturers are talking about, everything will be just fine.",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor Wu is an outstanding lecturer, but keep an eye on taking notes as the PowerPoint only provides a few details; the most information comes from the lecturer&#039;s speech.<br /><br />Professor Zhang and Professor Li are really helpful; whenever I do not understand the lesson and inquire with them via email, they will always give clear and understandable answers! I should say that this really helps me a lot in comprehending the topics. All the notes are shown on the ppt, notes are not much needed.<br /><br />Professor He&#039;s presentation is always the longest and the most uncomprehendable. It&#039;s still acceptable :)",
      "comment_grading": "I am not certain about the percentage of the A range that this course allocated to the students; however, I heard that the A range is about 15% to 20%. OCES 1010 puts more consideration into your attendance (40%), which is recorded in the style of class quizzes, so make sure to attend and not miss each of the classes since some lecturers will not tell you when specific lectures will have a quiz and when they will not (it somewhat resembles a surprise quiz). You do not need to worry about the accuracy of the quiz because its importance is to attend it. As long as you attend it, you will get nearly a perfect score already. The accuracy is just a matter of decimals, like one correct answer for 0.1. Moreover, the midterm and final are all open notes, which account for about 30%, respectively. The final will not include what has been taught before the midterm, so not much is needed to be prepared before the exams.<br /><br />Midterm: 30 (mean: 26 ~ 27)<br /><br />Final: not released, but I think quite high<br /><br />Letter Grade: A-<br /><br />The score is quite satisfying from my point of view as a science A student, as I do not have any prior knowledge with regards to biology and geography (the two most relevant subjects in OCES 1010). Most important, I eventually dedicate so few hours to learning this (compared to math and physics).",

For the midterm I vigorously took notes only for prof Wu&#039;s sessions and never reviewed the topics, and for the final exam I didn&#039;t even look at one single ppt slide until 20 minutes before the actual exam but finally got a B+.

Otherwise it&#039;s &quot;useless&quot;.",
      "comment_teaching": "Teaching styles varies greatly every few lectures because 4 professors teach this course. The actual judgement of the quality of the lecturer&#039;s teachings really depends on each person&#039;s individual opinion for this course, so here&#039;s mine. Generally, I don&#039;t really have an exceptionally good opinion for any of the professor&#039;s teaching; it was mediocre at best and confusing and unnecessary at worst. <br /><br />Wu (Teaches 33% of the course): Wu covers evolution, genetics, and general biology. Think IB Biology Topics 4 and 5. Wu was by far the best professor during this course; he would explain the content clearly while GIVING EXAMPLES(only lecturer that really &quot;taught&quot; the concepts) while inserting recap slides before each new lecture to remind people of the previous content taught. <br /><br />Zhang (Teaches 17% of the course): Zhang covers toxic chemicals, different diseases, environmental health, and relations between food production/supply and environment. Her lectures comprise of generic teaching of content that is way harder than anything Wu taught, and the way she delivers this content is just so boring and uninspiring. She just reads her monitor for 1.5 hours and calls it a day. The good thing about her lectures is that her slides literally cover EVERYTHING she talked about in class, so you don&#039;t even need to rewatch her lecture videos to understand her portion of the content. <br /><br />Li (Teaches 27% of the course): Li covers the atmosphere structure and air pollution, water supply, groundwater, water pollution and remediation. Her teaching was fine; she would also put recap of previous lectures at the beginning of each new lecture to allow students to brush up on content<br /><br />He (Teaches 23% of the course): What the hell, his teaching and the content he taught were an absolute train wreck. He starts off relatively normal with energy methods but then covers oddly specific and convoluted content like solid waste management, microplastic supply and accumulation, and marine environment protection. No, we do NOT want to listen for hours on what your colleague did in Zhejiang, we want you to TEACH THE CLASS. He also chooses content that are far more difficult than the other professors. He also only recites his lecture slides, and he would often skip entire slides or sections because his powerpoints are so long; they are also a nightmare to read through and go over because of how disorganized they were; full of random information that never appeared in the final exam (no joke an entire portion of his oceanography lecture was about James Cameron driving a submarine). As the course coordinator, He&#039;s teaching and content that he selected was ironically, by far, the worst. Good luck revising his lectures. By the way, the Kurzgesagt and DW documentary videos he listed as &quot;additional resources&quot; at the end of his lectures taught me more about the content than the lectures itself. SMH, absolute disaster. <br /><br />Overall, I wouldn&#039;t call any of the 4 professors &quot;fascinating&quot; to attend their lectures, maybe Wu was above average but there is definitely room for improvement",
      "comment_grading": "At least this super boring course has a very generous grading system<br /><br />30% midterms<br />30% finals<br />40% in-class participation/attendance (yes it&#039;s true, for a SSCI foundation course)<br /><br />Midterms and finals comprise of multiple choice questions(both single and multiple choice answers) as a couple of short answer/mini-essay questions. Nothing too complicated. <br /><br />Midterms and finals are pretty much even in terms of weight, and given that midterms were much easier than finals, the grading system for this course is good. <br /><br />My scores:<br />Midterm: 35/40<br />Final: Unknown<br />Grade: A+",
      "comment_workload": "Pretty much little to no workload without factoring in revision<br /><br />When 40% of the grade depends on you existing, then the amount of workload you receive in this course is self-explanatory(I didn&#039;t even click the box for if quizzes were given in this course because they only check attendance and not even right/wrong answers). <br />Some instructor&#039;s content requires little to no time to revise, others are an absolute pain.<br /><br />Tip for revision if you have a Mac: Download all the lecture slides, highlight important portions, and command f ever key word per question in the exam, and see that the answers are pretty much GIVEN to you. You’ll have time; they give you 3 whole hours for finals and most were gone by hour 2",
