    "description": "The aim of this course is to develop a deep understanding why the economic doctrine that the only social responsibility of corporations is to maximize profits does no longer work in todayâ€™s capital markets. The course provides theoretical and empirical findings that illustrate that financial decisions need to incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors to ensure long-term financial success of firms. The course also covers new trends, such as U.S. political polarization and the important role of China in establishing a global leadership role in green finance, which may impact how corporations are becoming more responsible.",
