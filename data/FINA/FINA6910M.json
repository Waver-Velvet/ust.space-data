    "description": "Structured products (e.g., principal-protected notes) are one of the major products manufactured and distributed by investment banks given the increasing demand from institutional and individual investors. In order to support and grow the structured product business, a variety of functions or roles are developed in the financial industry, including traders, quants, structurers, and sales, etc. at investment banks or relationship managers and product specialists at private banks. As a result, all the financial practitioners are assumed to have basic and practical knowledge about structured products. This course is designed for students who are pursuing front-office careers at investment banks, private banks, or asset management companies. It covers basic concepts of structured products, introduces popular products in the market (e.g., principal protected notes and equity-linked notes), and discusses the landscape of product manufacturing and distribution process. It focuses on applications rather than theory by illustrating real-world examples as well as their practical implementations in the industry.",
