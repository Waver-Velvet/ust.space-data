Content is qualitative, 0需要計數。But since it&#039;s easy to grasp, people score high marks in quizzes.<br /><br />If you want to learn about entrepreneurship and want to avoid Maths, this is the 101 course for you.",
      "comment_teaching": "To be more unbiased, i&#039;ll try to comment on both the pros and cons <br /><br />Pros<br />1. Lecture videos will be provided<br />2. Explanation is pretty clear even though his Korean accent is hard to understand <br />3. Lecture slides are easy to follow <br /><br />Cons<br />1. Unresponsive. I sent him 3 emails but he never replied. The most unresponsive prof i&#039;ve met in ust so far. <br />2. Disorganized. If you like surprises maybe he&#039;s for you. In the syllabus, the individual asm (10%) is said to be due by the end of Sept, but no further instructions were given until mid Oct on Canvas and due in Nov. The content of it changed as well. <br /><br />For the group project, the deadlines specified in the syllabus was also false. No Canvas assignment was set up for us to submit so we submitted through email but he postponed it afterwards. <br /><br />On the first presentation day, since he managed time poorly, some groups can&#039;t present and had to postpone. For groups on day 2, they get to chose out-of-class times.<br /><br />如果你想搏佢會postpone deadline，歡迎同佢玩<br />3. Bias. As an entrepreneurship professor, he has a strong bias towards his insight shaped by his industry experience in the US and South Korea. This is particularly troublesome for the group project because whether he understands what your group put forward and whether he likes it determines your project grade (40%).",

Class participation<br />Although there&#039;re lecture videos, if you want to earn participation, then you have to attend classes. I didn&#039;t read the cases beforehand but he asked about the case, so you should 預習 according to his guide and raise your hand as many times as possible because competition is fierce. I attended 90% of the lessons and raised my hands 10+ times but never got called. You have 7 chances in total for you to earn participation grade.<br /><br />2. Individual assignment<br />Max. 2-page so not a lot of work. Originally it should be for us to brainstorm startup ideas, but since he postponed it, it became supportive evidence for our project (imo harder to stand out)<br /><br />3. Team project<br />Depends on group mates as always. The good thing (or maybe not) is he allows your group to choose the topic, which means you can leverage your own experiences. No report, just a 10-page pitch deck. But he never posts Canvas assignments for groups&nbsp;&nbsp;to submit so many groups change their deck and content.<br /><br />4. Exams<br />I didn&#039;t do well so I didn&#039;t exert enough effort. Work hard and memorize the deck if you want a better grade.",

No namecard, no parti card, and everyone just pretends having answered question at the end of each class and writes their names on a paper for Prof&#039;s grading.<br /><br />Even worse, no any assignment, exam, nor the presentation got released with scores. It is literally a black hole, I submitted everything but got returned nothing -.- The professor even once missed the submission date to set up Canvas assignment for uploading the case studies, what a joke.<br /><br />I got unknown in participation, unknown in case assignments, unknown in project, unknown in final exam, then got an A-<br /><br />Very interesting case, i totally have no idea whether the grading is good or bad, lmao",
      "comment_workload": "Low workload. You will need to do a presentation at the end, but thats common. Several case studies are needed and perhaps they are the only workloads.<br /><br />Final exam questions are vague af and I am not sure if studying helps. Yet, there will be some questions related to the cases so remember to digest all cases carefully even you did not do the previous case assignments seriously.",

They were open-end questions so you wouldn&#039;t feel stressed to get the &quot;right&quot; answer. <br /><br />There might be a 1-page reading at the end of the lecture. He would give you a couple of minutes and would encourage the class to discuss ideas based on it. <br /><br />He started class right on time, not even 1 minute late. <br /><br />There&#039;s a group project which asked students to prepare a pitch and business plan for a start-up idea to be launched in the Chinese/HK market. It could be any idea - exiting ones, or sth from your own. This business idea would be the core part of your group project for the rest of your semester.",
      "comment_teaching": "The ideas about entrepreneurship and innovation were easy to understand. The prof explained them clearly with a lot of real-life examples. <br /><br />Around 1 week before the Mid Term, he would post the lecture videos on Canvas.<br /><br />For the group project, he was very willing to meet with students to discuss how to improve our presentation. He would post time slots on Canvas and you could sign up.",
