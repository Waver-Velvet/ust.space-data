    "description": "Demand for sustainable supply chains is on the rise. Companies face increasing pressure to become more sustainable from various stakeholders, such as policymakers, shareholders, investors, and NGOs. At the same time, consumers demand more sustainable products and services. While many organizations have established goals to reduce emissions or become carbon neutral in the next 10 to 20 years, they struggle to translate these goals into specific actions and strategies. People in organizations may ask questions like: How do we scope the analysis of our supply chains? What is the proper methodology to estimate emissions? This course will highlight pathways for how you can help build sustainable supply chains for organizations to achieve their sustainability goals.",
