I believe 2 days are enough for each assignment in average.<br /><br />It&#039;s better to start earlier for the group project. Our group spent around 10 days to finish the report &amp; coding.

      "comment_teaching": "Jason is definitely the best instructor I have ever met in HKUST although this is the first course he has ever taught and he is only a PhD student studying IS. He explains everything clearly and often gives insights into how the contents can be applicable to real-life contexts and may sometimes introduce how the application is used in his own company (yes, he is also an entrepreneur). You can feel he does know the topic very well and could answer every question that students raised. He is so helpful that he always asks students to send him emails when we have any questions and he does replies very fast during working hours (like replying within 15 mins, do appreciate that). <br /><br />Enough the appreciation above, his teaching of course does have some flaws. I think the biggest problem would be the pronunciation thing. This does not happen very often, but he sometimes pronounces a few words wrong (not because of his accent) and we may not know what he is talking about. Also, for the lab parts, sometimes Jason goes through the codes so fast that we can&#039;t really follow them. I think that is because he already typed all the code before the labs and he simply scroll through and highlight the codes and said, &quot;we have this line of code, so we have this result.&quot;, but I don&#039;t really understand what parameters do I need in the code (maybe that&#039;s because I didn&#039;t take ISOM3400 before taking this course?!). I think it would be better if Jason types the code with us in the lab so that we can type and follow will help us to understand the codes better.<br /><br />After all, although there are some flaws regarding pronunciations and labs, the good things outweigh the flaws and make him a very very good and thoughtful instructor.",

Another part of the assignment is related to the lab (which is coding). We need to finish the task by Python coding. I think this is quite challenging for me, since I need to spend so much time in debugging and reviewing the lab(since I cannot really understand the coding in lab sessions as mentioned in the teaching part).<br /><br />For the group project, we are required to solve a business problem using data mining.

So my performance in this part would just be average (or even lower than)<br /><br />class participation-<br />they didn&#039;t release anything about it. But i attend almost all the real-time lectures and respond (by typing in the textbox) frequently. <br /><br />Homework Assignments *2 -<br />individual. some needs hand writing, just conceptual problems taught in the class. There are also coding tasks. The workload might be a little big because it&#039;s the first time for me to conduct a complete project (the &#039;Titanic&#039; case in Assighment 1) by myself. But the grades of the coding tasks only depends on your efforts and logic (instead of accuracy) so just be relaxed. everyone can get nearly full scores in all assignments!<br />me: full score in all assignments except for one 90/100.<br /><br />Group Project-<br />They didn&#039;t release the score of group project. <br />tip: try to communicate with the prof and TA as much as possible! try to get feedback/advice from them (there will be 2 advising sessions). Knowing what they are expecting from you will contribute a lot to your work.<br /><br />Midterm-<br />I didn&#039;t do well in the midterm. The mean is 14.7/20, and I got 15.4. Only slightly higher than the mean.<br /><br />Final-<br />They didn&#039;t release the scores of final. The format is quite similar to midterm. MCQ, short answer questions (explanation, calculation). The time will be tight. Remember to manage the time!<br /><br />My final grade: A<br />As you can see, I only get mean in lab quiz, assignment and midterm. Although the score of group project and final are not released, &#039;A&#039; is definitely out of my expectation!!! I would expect B or B+(if better). But eventually I got A! Really amazing!! Thanks Prof. Yang ❤<br /><br />I&#039;m a person who seldom write reviews in USTSPACE. But this time I seriously write a review for ISOM3360. Just want everyone to know how kind Prof. Yang is. Don&#039;t hesitate!",
      "comment_workload": "Although Prof.Yang gives amazing teaching and good grades, I would say this course has a heavy workload.<br />There are usually three hand-written problems in assignments and one coding task. For the first hands-on coding task, it took me a whole week! There are also weekly quizzes after the lab. The deadline is one day later at 23:59. It&#039;s really common to forget the deadline... I missed one. Luckily, the lab only takes up 5% in the grading scheme.<br />The most difficult part would be the group project. You need a large dataset. A complete data mining solutions from nothing! There will be no templates (like in ISOM 2600). You need to write every line of codes by yourself. It&#039;s important to team up with good guys... or it will kill you!<br />You also need to submit a report. Try to think of a concrete problem from your dataset. And utilizing data mining skillls taught in lab as many as possible.",

I mean sure you can go to him for Azure stuff but you&#039;ll end up seeing him trying even harder than you to know how to work the system.

Not sure what I got in the finals or the project because the stats were not released, but I eventually got an A.<br /><br />I suspect that the project and finals do help put people into different grades because most students would get similar results in other things, such as assignments and labs.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also give you simple tips to get good grades with YY:<br />1. attend all the labs and submit the worksheet after the lab (Sophie gives most of the answers!)<br />2. attend the midterm and final review sessions because there might be some lectures or parts of it that is not included in the exam, but you won&#039;t know it if you don&#039;t go... and waste your time studying<br />3. please don&#039;t give yourself such a hard time by making up an impossible challenge for the project - this obviously also affects the workload you will get!<br />4. if you&#039;re going to do a predictive task for the project, you may also want to interpret the prediction results (as in, what does the root node of the decision tree tell you?)",

Both the midterm and final exam include multiple-choice questions as well as short questions (descriptive and calculation), and the mean for the midterm exam was 85/100 with an SD Of 8 or so. The final exam statistics were not released, therefore I can&#039;t comment on it. <br /><br />There are two homework assignments which consist of 3-4 short questions, and the mean for these tends to be pretty high (e.g. mean of 1.95/2 for most questions).",

The homework assignments are quite straightforward (apart from the Microsoft Azure-related questions, which just take AAAGES to run sometimes). <br /><br />The project is a new component of the course, and you have to find a business problem and use data mining techniques to build a model to achieve the data mining objective.

For multiple choice questions, they are quite tricky sometimes, so if you do not understand some basics concept in the course, you must ask them clearly, so you can answer multiple choice questions.",
      "comment_workload": "The course have 3 assignments. The assignment are quite easy. Only some sub-questions would be challenging and require you to think about it thoroughly. For the exam, it is not too hard. The only things you need to do is to go through all the notes and make sure you understand the basic concepts.",

It is not too complicated as long as you pay attention in class and read the suggested textbook.",
      "comment_teaching": "Well to be honest, I think her teaching is boring and sometimes hard to understand. And by purely looking at the ppt notes, you might not know what it is talking about, so you are highly encourage to attend the lesson and listen and ask questions after class. Lab sessions are easy, the TA teaches quite well and she will give out the answer at the end of each session. Labs are mainly teaching you how to use Weka and cover a small part on Microsoft Azure.",
      "comment_grading": "1. Lab participation: 10%<br />2. Homework (3): 30%<br />3. Midterm quiz: 30%<br />4. Final exam: 30%<br /><br />For both Midterm and Finals, there are 3 parts:<br />True/False<br />MC Questions<br />Long questions<br />For the long questions, they require certain degree of understanding and Final has a lot of the long questions that you need to write out the whole mining process. Midterm is very easy therefore if you score high marks there could help your grade a lot.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is very small, just 3 HW, midterm and final. The labs just make sure u attend is ok, but paying attention in labs might be able help you with the HW. The HW consists of two parts, part 1 is about what you have learn in class, usually some calculations questions. For part 2, it is a hands on question where you are required to use Weka to process the given information and answer the questions. All the instructions are written clearly on the question so you don&#039;t have to worry not knowing how to extract the data. And if in doubt, you can always ask the TA and she will check yours and and give you feedback on how to improve your answers.",
