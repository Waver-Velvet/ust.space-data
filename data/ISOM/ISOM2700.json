You can refer to the other sections of what this class is about, basically complicated math that (in my humble opinion) I think has no applicability in real life. One of those courses where you will never use the stuff you learnt again in real life. <br /><br />For example, you will learn how to &quot;optimise&quot; inventory and &quot;optimal order quantity&quot; with some complicated formula. But, WHY does this matter to us &quot;business&quot; students, a point of a business is to generate revenue, and what we learn has no correlation to generate revenue at all. It doesn&#039;t matter if you are a master at managing inventory when no one buys - and this is the struggle of most business and for us business students. <br /><br />That being said, if you work for a global business like Mcdonalds, then yeah maybe you need to use those complex formulas to know how many burgers to make. But if the professor said that nowadays most inventory can be managed via computer systems or AI, so why are we learning this...",

      "title": "COURSE OVERVIEW &amp; OBJECTIVE Operations is one of the primary functions of a firm, concerned with the transformation of inputs (e.g., raw material, labor, capital, and information) into outputs (goods or services). Whereas marketing focuses on the demand for the product, finance provides the capital for the product, and operations produces and delivers the product, including procurement, production, distribution, warehousing, and retailing, with the objective of creating competitive advantage for the enterprise. This course provides a foundation for understanding the operations of a firm. We concentrate on a small number of powerful themes that have emerged recently as the central building blocks of world-class operations. We also present a sample of operations management tools and techniques that have FALL 2022_ISOM2700_Prof. Lu 2 been proved extremely useful over the years. Our objective by the end of the course is to provide you with the analytical skills and managerial insights necessary to critically analyze a firm&#039;s operations decisions and practices. Such knowledge is important for careers in a variety of areas, including general management, entrepreneurship, investment banking (e.g. business restructurings, mergers and acquisitions), venture capital (e.g. evaluating new business plans) and management consulting (business restructuring improvement)",

The mean for his class is high, which means you have little chance but to gain perfect marks if you screwed your midterm a little bit (not above 1 sd which is me). Overall his exam is not really easy and he limits 20% A range while other instructors may give 25% or just tell you they will give you an A- if you exceed 90% instead of playing a shitty puzzle around you.

They are designed to be more difficult than the graded quizzes (i.e. you&#039;ll deal with short questions instead of MC) and are very helpful for revision.",

So now I am here to tell you more about this super nice professor!<br /><br />Prof Shen is extremely responsive and polite. He is super willing to respond to our enquires and questions. One thing that shocked me the most is that I am able to get his response via email within 20 mins every time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he puts a huge effort in teaching. You could definitely feel his passion if you were his students. His PPT is clear and to-the-point which is easy for me to comprehend. He also controls the pace of his teaching well. More on that, his pronunciation is clear and he is good at explaining concepts. Stupid people like me are able to understand what’s going on during the lecture. One thing that I love the most is that he will finish one PPT per lecture, and never splitting one PPT between 2 lectures. So every lecture will always start with a new topic. It is extremely friendly for students like me who will never revisit the learnt material after class:). However, no attendance is taken in his lesson and lecture recordings are uploaded on canvas punctually. Around 70% of students skipped his lesson. It is sad to see as Prof Shen really prepared a lot for his lecture.<br /><br />In order to help us to prepare well for the exams, he posts a lot of practice questions of every chapter on Canvas and the question type is similar to what appeared in the exam. <br /><br />Note: Every Monday he will hold a one hour consultation session online for us to ask questions. <br /><br />He is a humble person who always ask for feedback about his lesson. (He really listened what we said and made improvement!!!)<br /> <br />The TA Jing is also very responsive and polite. In paper checking session, she will explain to us EVERY question that we got wrong in detail, even if I didn’t ask her. I saw her spending 45 mins explaining concepts to a student during the paper checking session.",

Besides, He shared many inspiring videos and business articles (some are captured from top consulting firms like MBB) to help us with building better business acumen. <br /><br />2. He provides well-organized teaching materials following the problem-solving approach ( the general flow of the teaching materials is like this: what&#039;s the importance of learning that topic, why we need to learn it -&gt; what is the problem we are solving -&gt; what are the concepts and approaches we can use to solve that problem) <br /><br />3. He updates the contents of teaching materials regularly to ensure we are learning the most updated know-how in the operational management industry.<br /><br />4.

[no excel work for every lesson, dun be scared, he will tell you when to do it.]<br /><br />Weekly quizzes:<br />Some very easy and short questions, which answers could be found in the links provided. Some simple calculations and mc questions. Really easy to gain full credit. Weekly quizzes do not take you much time usually, except for those that require excel work, which might take about 30-60 mins, but no difficulty:)<br /><br />Mid-term and final are both in MC format. As I rmb, 40 MCs in mid-term and 50/60(?) MCs are in the final. Some are conceptual and some are mathematical. Formulas sheet will be provided in the exam paper, so no need to recite them. Suri will make an announcement about the exams. Like this: Ch1 (X questions are conceptual and Y questions are calculations). So just make sure you understand the concepts!!!

Just prepare your cheat sheet carefully with certain level of understanding of the topic can help you get a high grade.<br />(fyr: most of my friends taking this session just prepared the cheat sheet for exams and did nothing else but still can get A range. 1 even only read the ppt a few days before the exams and get A-)<br />There are some supplementary problems sets for your own study. They are somehow more difficult than exam questions and are not mcs. It will be fine if you ignore them.",

The content lists are below:<br /> 1) Managing Process and Resource <br />• Process analysis and its applications; <br />• Quality management; <br />• Resource management.<br />2) Managing Service System <br />• Coping with variability of service system; <br />• Separating vs. pooling servers; <br />• Queuing models;<br />• Simulating service system.<br />3) Matching Supply with Demand <br />• Economic order quantity (EOQ) model; <br />• Newsvendor model; <br />• Demand forecasting and revenue management.<br />4) Managing Supply Chain <br />• Value of flexibility and postponement;<br />• Information distortion: Bullwhip effect; <br />• Supply chain coordination via contract.<br />Seems like a lot but it really isn&#039;t. Perfectly manageable and reading and taking some time to understand the slides and you will do fine in this course.",
      "comment_teaching": "The slides are basically sufficient for your exam and the professor posts recordings on Canvas but based off my experience, reading the slides will be sufficient and attending the lectures themselves will not be necessary. However, you may be able to benefit from the lectures as the professor will explain some practical questions in class that students find hard to understand and some of them are questions that will show up in your homework. The professor can be quite eccentric but is flexible to comment and is willing to change his teaching activities based on demand.",
      "comment_grading": "Since every assignment and exams are basically MCs, there is not really much room for the professor to give you looser grading or whatever. However, the professor will give you written detailed explanations on homework and has a review session for the midterm.(None for the final, which is a norm for UST). Therefore, the grading is reasonable and there is nothing special about it and you can always understand which part did you mess up in your homework or exam afterwards.",
      "comment_workload": "For exams, the professors give you sufficient material in your homework and practice problems to help you prepare for them. Basically start revising a few days before exam and revise a topic a day and do one set of practice questions. That basically only takes at most two hours( a conservative estimate) and you will be fine in your exams. As for homework, the professor literally only set a one hour limit for your homework so there is no need to worry that you need to spend hours on homework as there is simply no such possibility. However, the homework can be quite challenging and that one hour will be barely enough for you to do all your tasks.",

I don&#039;t really understand and like this kind of course, where they don&#039;t even allow you to check your answers and mistakes, where some students just want to understand their mistakes and are not just chasing for extra marks.<br /><br />Quoted from the Announcements:<br />&quot;We have checked the answer and error rate for each exam question thoroughly and didn&#039;t find any major issue. Since we already adjusted the cutoff points with a much larger margin than usual for assigning grades, there is really no reason for anyone to try to argue about the correctness or interpretation of some individual answers. Therefore, paper checking is not encouraged.<br /><br />Likewise, even if you are at the very border of the cutoff point of another higher grade, we won&#039;t consider making further adjustment as everyone has already received one or two sub-letter grade better than what you expect if a regular grading scheme is applied.&quot;",

For a student who has basically no business background like me, Prof.Gurumurthi&#039;s class could not only be an introductory course for OM, but also a good introductory to the business world.<br /><br />CHOOSE HIM!!!

Interesting course if you want to know more about operations management.",

However, his voice is quite boring which sometimes I may fell asleep in his lessons (I&#039;m taking the morning session).<br /><br />This semester, he used blended learning mode which you need to watch online lectures also. His online lectures are super useful as he will provide more details and skills for a certain concept or calculation. Make sure you study all online lectures if you are in his class. There is some extra information which is not included in class lectures.<br /><br />Overall speaking, his teaching is good except he always updates his powerpoint few minutes before the start of the lesson and seldom explained much for some difficult concepts but using a lot of time to explain some simple common sense.",

      "comment_workload": "Quite heavy for a 3 credit course.<br />Although Ronald used blended learning mode, you still have to attend 2 lessons mostly per week. Apart from class lectures, you still have to go home and watch online lectures which last about 40 minutes on average.<br />Don&#039;t forget your bi-weekly iprs or canvas quiz! Revision is really required or you won&#039;t answer correctly and you will miss a lot of participation marks which will directly affect your final grade. Even top-up discussion on canvas can save you 0.5 marks at most, so it is not easy at all.<br /><br />If you are taking this course with some other courses with presentations or weekly assignments, GOOD LUCK to you! You will feel tortured watching Ronald&#039;s face almost every week.",

The full mark is 2 every week. The quiz is not so difficult but if you want to get full mark, please find some one to complete together. The iprs is not easy seems you cannot review all the ppt every week. Sometimes you just guess. The class activities is easy lar. Don&#039;t worry, if you cannot get full mark in the above things, you can write something in the canvas online discussion forum, they will add more 0.5 bonus point to you. But the top limit is always 2 marks.<br />The midterm and final is not so difficult. But the mean is quite high, so be careful. Remember to review all the ppt including the online class.<br />I didn&#039;t do well in the class participation seems I didn&#039;t do well and could not get full mark in some IPRS.

It made his SFQ going down from ~90% to ~50%, and triggered a course review from the department.<br /><br />This year, he greatly reduced the number of games (3 this year). It was no longer a workload, but an event to rescue student&#039;s grade. He remade some videos online, they looked neat and tidy. He spent more time in class to teach, this kept students&#039; learning in progress. On top of all these, he removed the project. <br /><br />The contents itself did not change much.",

Examples of such processes include auto manufacturing process, servicing customers in restaurants/coffee shops, healthcare services offered by hospitals, online marketplaces, sharing-economy platforms or airlines offering connections between different cities. These businesses/organizations are primarily concerned about: (1) creating value through products/services, which in turn generates demand; and (2) satisfying the demand in an “efficient’’ fashion. In this course, we will address the latter issue in a systematic fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />(course description from SPRING 2018 course syllabus) <br /><br />Personally, the content is very interesting for me since it&#039;s very practicable.

And since the midterm (35%) and the final exam (45%) are all just MC questions and this course mainly talks about applying formulas to calculate like the number of customers waiting in line or how much inventory do we need to order, if you can get an answer more or less the same as the MC choices provided to you, you can still get the answer by choosing the closest one. However, if you are not that type who are good at MC, be careful of it.<br /><br />His grading also base on other aspects such as participation 5%(randomly taking attendance) and the homework assignment 15%. But I would say that these 20% is quite easy to get as long as you really do your homework and take attendance (actually you may even ask your friend to check whether that lesson have to take attendance or not and you go to lesson when there is attendance taking on that day, but attendance taking will be available for the first 15mins only!!!).",
      "comment_workload": "I would say his workload is quite heavy compared to other courses. Even though there isn&#039;t any group work, but sometimes he gave out assignments in a very short period. For example, assignment 2 was due on Mar 9 but assignment 3 was due on Mar 16. And then assignment 4 was due on Apr 11 while assignment 5 was due on Apr 20. It might be a little bit harsh. But luckily no more group projects or presentations are needed.",

Make sure u copy all down and revise at home.<br /><br />For cheatsheet, u can bring a 2-sided A4 cheatsheet in both exams. I recommend you to directly put useful slides on the sheet. Using a 1x2 per page cutting, u will be able to put 100 slides on the sheet and this will be enough.",

Before the midterm the course content is basically some fundamental concepts and a few formulae to apply in the queuing model part, so it should be manageable for most students. The difficulty increases after the midterm cuz it involves identifying the situation and applying the same formula (especially the newsvendor formula and the critical fractile thingy) in seemingly very different contexts. Make sure you grasp the concept well and know how to apply appropriate formulae based on the situation given.<br /><br />But overall this course is pretty easy to handle if you&#039;ve attended all the lessons and paid some effort in understanding the materials. It&#039;s recommended that you&#039;ve taken the statistics course (ISOM2500) before you register this course to help you better understand the lecture materials. The Excel skills she teaches is optional, but you may wanna learn a bit of them cuz they&#039;re so damn useful. (You have to know how to read the Excel sensitivity analysis tho)",

      "comment_grading": "1) Class attendance (10%), 5 random checks during class time<br />2) Class participation (15%), really no idea how he gave out the score for this<br />3) Discussion papers (15%), 5 cases in total<br />4) Group assignment (10%), 1 video presentation+report <br />5) Midterm+final exams (50%), half MC half calculation<br /><br />Almost every group got full mark for all case discussion work, so the 2 exams contributed to most of the final grade, but they are really easily and straight forward. Everything in the exam had been taught. Calculation taught during class time had similar difficulty as in the exam. Calculation exercises uploaded to canvas were quite useful.<br /> <br />I scored above mean (SD not provided) for both exams, below mean for participation and I am very satisfied with my grade.",
      "comment_workload": "There were 2 group works throughout the semester, which only contributed to 25% of the course, but they took some time to do it, especially for the 5 discussion papers. <br /><br />Some case studies were used only for class discussion purpose, and all cases were not appeared in the exam!! So... :P<br /><br />Exams were not cumulative and the notes were quite easily to follow, it shouldn&#039;t be a big deal to study for the 2 exams as long as you understand the lecture notes (and attend the class).",

That being said, the textbook has a lot of practice problems for the news-vendor model and capacity management topics, so it&#039;s useful to do these as practice for the final exam.",

He is really helpful and it&#039;s very easy to approach him and ask him questions about the course content or your group project (our group sent him a draft version of our report and he helped us a lot with it). <br /><br />He tries his best to keep the lectures interesting, and gives plenty of opportunities for students to participate and speak up with their opinions and thoughts. He&#039;s really friendly, and his passion for teaching is evident during classes. One thing he really hates, though, is people that talk during class and disrupt other students.",

The group project is also quite simple, as it&#039;s based on identifying and solving the bottleneck of an everyday process (max. 3 pages). You also need to create a video presentation for your group project.<br /><br />It is important to read all the cases before class though, especially if you want to participate during class when the professor asks case-related questions. <br /><br />For revision, going through the lecture slides and case studies should be enough to gain a complete understanding of what&#039;s required for the exam.",

Final + Midterm account for 50%.<br />The final and midterm were easy, since he only tested you the materials he taught. <br />Besides lecture notes, all of the case studies were also included in the final and midterm. However, don&#039;t worry, they are quite intuitive. <br /><br />2. Class Participation (15%)<br />I think class participation plays a major role if you want to get A-range for this course. You should always try to contribute some ideas during the lectures to get the participation marks, since other people should get quite the same scores as yours in terms of attendance, case paper, and group project.<br /><br />No one really knows how he distribute the participation marks. Neither the professor nor the TA record the students&#039; names when the students participated in class discussion. <br /><br />For me, I moderately participated and contributed in the discussion. At last, the class participation mark I received was quite satisfactory. Perhaps, it was because only a few students really took part in the discussion. So, it&#039;s your call guysss<br /><br />3. Class Attendance (10%)<br /><br />4. Group Case Discussion Paper (15% - 5 case)<br />All of the groups get 100 for all of the cases (except once, one of the group got 75). The objective of case discussions was only to encourage students to read the case before the class. <br /><br />5. Group Project (10% - Video Presentation + Report)",
      "comment_workload": "Average workload.<br /><br />There are:<br />1. 5 case discussions, with maximum 2 pages each. (Group)<br /><br />2. Group project at the end of the course (Video Presentation 15 minutes + Report 4 pages). Basically, the group project aims to let you identify what problems are there in a particular company or shop of your choice, and then ask you to improve or solve the problem. You can easily incorporate the knowledge you learn in the course to do finish the group project. <br /><br />3. In total, there are around 10 case studies that you should read before the lectures. I highly recommend you to read the cases he provided because they are directly related to the lectures. <br />He will always discuss the case in class, and ask some questions about it. He also encourage student to participate during discussion.",

I would say that I am a student who cannot tolerate boring class because I will definitely fall asleep out of my control, but I have never fell asleep in his class throughout the semester.

There is only 1 open book/computer quiz (you won&#039;t know how to do that anyway but it counts as participation marks only) after each topic. There is NO homework!

Lecture notes, online notes, course booklet, videos etc. Teaching pace is a bit slow compare to other professors because the scope of his class is less than others. In-class quizzes are used to take attendance sometimes.",
      "comment_grading": "My grade is good but really not sure about the general grading. Prof. Suri likes to keep the mean score of his tests at 80%. So don&#039;t be too happy if you receive a 9X%. Probably one fifth of your classmates have higher mark than you. Be sure to check out your class score distribution.",

Come to class - many benefits: a. get score in your in-class tasks, b. answer/ ask questions to make him recognize you, c. there are some examples he talks about in the class but aren&#039;t featured on the ppt slides nor the Canvas pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he does upload lecture videos, some of them are editted so you may not be able to get everything jotted down if you don&#039;t go to class.<br />3. Submit the work on time - and remember quality of work also matters. <br />4. Remember that he doesn&#039;t like giving fail grades, so your only hope is to revise often because there&#039;s no way you&#039;re gonna rely on the booklet in the exam. You are gonna write notes in it beforehand.",

Not if you&#039;ve worked out a way to cooperate with your teammates: the case studies are groupwork and you can assign one question to each of the 5 members if there are 5 questions in the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the video is just 3 minutes or so, which means it&#039;s not very substantial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat it as a vocal summary of your paper - which isn&#039;t a big deal either if you start gathering ideas earlier on.",
