However, the power point had almost no words in it, there&#039;s only pictures. So, you really have to pay attention in class and write notes. It is also kinda hard to learn Chinese history in English. Therefore this course is somehow interesting but it&#039;s hard.",

He was also patient in answering question and he was happy students ask him questions.

      "comment_content": "The most important purpose of the course is to explore what constitutes modern China, which means defining the term &quot;modern&quot; from various perspectives. Modern China can refer to the industrial revolution, political system reforms, or the unique Chinese model. Today&#039;s China is vastly different from both the China of the Manchu people&#039;s entry in 1644 and the China of the Mao Zedong era. The establishment of the Later Jin dynasty, the Eight Banners system, the Confucian successors, the Complete Library in Four Sections, the Southern Tour, the corruption of the Eight Banners, the Opium War, the Open Door Policy, failed internal reforms, revolution, the Twenty-One Demands, warlord conflicts, the Tanaka Memorial, resistance against Japan, the cooperation and civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the establishment of the People&#039;s Republic of China, the struggle against landlords, the socialist industrialization plan, the Great Famine, the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong&#039;s death, and the downfall of the Gang of Four.",
      "comment_teaching": "Very clear, obviously possessing solid knowledge of modern Chinese history. The most outstanding aspect is the explanation of Mark Elliott&#039;s new theory of Qing history. It explores whether the Qing dynasty was a Chinese regime or a Manchu empire. This argument extends to the Five-Race Republic theory proposed by revolutionary party members, as well as the subsequent controversy surrounding the assistance of the Japanese in establishing the Manchukuo.",
      "comment_grading": "Long essay exams test students&#039; true skills. To earn an A, students need to review information from Baidu Baike and their secondary school Chinese history notes on their own. Just do your revision. Go through notes after each lessons end. Read those materials if you like (Actually those are too advanced and I did not read any of them). The classroom notes only consist of pictures and brief introductions, so students must create their own electronic notes. The answering method can refer to the 25-point questions in the HKDSE Chinese History exam. It follows the structure of a topic sentence, description, hard historical facts, and elaboration. For example, let&#039;s introduce the First Opium War:<br /><br />1. Background (Imbalance in Sino-British trade)<br />2. Trigger (The Arrow Incident)<br />3. Process (Finding a pretext to declare war against China)<br />4. Outcome (The Treaty of Nanjing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Xiamen)<br />5. Impact (The most significant part) (Semi-colonial status, the opening of China&#039;s ports, trade imbalance, challenge to the concept of the Celestial Empire)<br /><br />Attendance just being recorded during add drop period.",
      "comment_workload": "I do not like the AI assignment section. Actually, it is similar to writing an essay but with the allowance of using Chat GPT to gain different points of view. Two exams are already enough. However, one assignment required students to decide exam questions, which is quite interesting.",

Although students have claimed that they could not understand what he was talking on lessons, I think this was mainly because he like to add some of his judgement on historical events. he was really patient to answer students questions and concerns on the course. He also gave comments and give instructions to our assignments which I think it was quite helpful for Year 1 students. Meanwhile, he did not like students trapped by the exam-oriented mindset so better asked him for instructions clearly on the assignment. However, the main point is his PPT slides mostly comprised of pictures and photos which required students to jot down everything he said and mentioned.",

Only read those Lawrence pointed out during the lecture would be fine. Lawrence had actually gave instructions on the assignment quite early. If you start it early and complete it bit by bit, I think it would not be a very big concern as a Year 1 student. Since the lecture did not count attendance at last, you may actually skipped all the lectures and just watched them before the final exam.",

Mr Ho’s tone is clear, and he would summarise the main ideas in last lesson, or picked a student to do so when every lessons started. <br /><br />He is more like a critic of Chinese history, he highlighted his objective of giving you a different view which official textbooks won’t tell. For example, he thought Britain wasn’t that responsible for the Opium War solely, Lin Zexu and Sun Yixian weren’t that intelligent and moral, Manzu’s reforms weren’t that Bad etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, a lot of content he mentioned will be useful for the exam (For mine, 3 out of 5 exam questions allowed you to copy directly of what he had said). Therefore it is easy to guess the questions by summarising the notes (Eg Why Lin Zexu was more responsible for the Opium War, Why Treaty ports brought benefits and less harms to China, Why China’s sovereignty wasn’t been infringed seriously...)<br /><br />Majority of textbook content hold an opposite view with Mr Ho, so the examples and statistics in it maybe useful, but not for the arguments.

As a foreigner who has never studied Chinese history in depth, this class was fascinating for me - but I&#039;m sure it was also fascinating to the Chinese students to re-learn their national history according to the professor&#039;s information/opinions.",

He has no powerpoints, slides, or supporting material other than a note-sheet he will hand out intermittently with tiny little fragments of his lectures on there - they&#039;re useless if you miss a class. Basically, if you miss a class and don&#039;t have a friend there taking notes for you, you&#039;re screwed. <br />However, it&#039;s clear that the professor really cares about the material, and he endeavors to answer every question thoroughly (although not necessarily concisely).",

We had received 0 grades for anything by the time we had written 2 of the discussions - this was upsetting as it gave us no way to know how well/poorly we had done, if we needed to improve or not. It was often not very clear what the professor wanted us to deliver - he would say we just needed to spend 20-30 minutes writing a quick response to the discussion questions, and then such answers received very low grades. This was confusing and frustrating at first, but once I figured this out, I did better.<br />My final grade in the class was a B+.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload was moderately heavy - lots of very dense readings, memorizing, and more more moreeee reading. <br />However, if you&#039;re an idiot (like me) you can put off the readings until right before the exam, cram everything into a final few days of frantic reading and studying, and it&#039;s not totally impossible that you&#039;ll do well :) -- but don&#039;t do this. Actually go to lecture! It&#039;s interesting and worthwhile. Read the readings when they are assigned so you don&#039;t get screwed during exams. Then you will be totally fine.",

      "comment_content": "中國近代史，由晚清講到抗日戰爭，DSE有讀過中西史嘅會輕鬆好多。Readings有中英文版，考試係英文卷但可以揀用中文或者英文答，有一半係要你背返歷史出嚟，例如叫你list out林則徐做過嘅5件事，之後嗰一半就係好似LS評論題咁寫essay，都要有史料support。",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor英文唔好但係要用英文講中史所以好多嘢都表達得幾吃力，會講得比較慢同混亂，但係如果對中史有興趣嘅話佢講嘅ideas都幾值得聽下。",

      "comment_workload": "Midterm係3題SQ同1題essay，Final係4題SQ同2題essay，考試言之成理就得，唔一定要用佢上堂講嘅points。Tutorial隔個禮拜一堂，其中一堂要負責present，其他堂就喺discussion表達下意見。<br /><br />其實除咗midterm final同present之外就冇乜其他計分嘅嘢做，但如果你冇讀過史你嘅workload就係睇同背readings，隔個禮拜嘅tutorial都要做discussion，變咗readings要keep住清，每次要睇2-3 chapters，都幾多information要process同summarise重點，唔係睇完就算，chur唔chur見仁見智，自己本身中學冇讀中西史，中三前嘅都已經忘記得七七八八，加上其他courses個個禮拜都有weekly嘅嘢要做，覺得幾辛苦。",

      "comment_teaching": "Professor Ho&#039;s teaching style is no doubt unique: some may find it intriguing, while some others would easily fall asleep on his lecture. Unlike history teachers in high school who focus on memorizing historical events, he tends to teach us by giving statistics and some stories. This means that we would have to go through the textbook ourselves to have the basic concept and timeline of major events. But still, for those who are bored with high school history class and want to hear something different, Professor Ho&#039;s lecture might be a good choice.",

The participation is mainly depended on how much did you speak in tutorials, so be prepared and read the materials beforehand. The essay topic can be chosen from 6 questions and the length is unlimited, so there&#039;s plenty much space for you to elaborate. The final exam is 3 hours long. We had to answer 3 essay questions. But all the questions are related to the lecture, so as long as you listen to lecture carefully, there&#039;s not much trouble.<br />For my personal case, I received B+ for participation and A for the essay, and my final grade is A-.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is mainly on readings and the essay. The readings are divided into 2 parts, required and optional. The required reading is Immanuel Hsu&#039;s &#039;The Rise of Modern China&#039;. But we don&#039;t have to read the whole book for the professor hardly covered half of the events in the book. The optional reading is much heavier, usually one book per topic, but since it&#039;s only optional it&#039;s up to you to decide if or not to read it. <br />As for the essay, the workload is really flexible as there&#039;s no word limit. People usually write around 3000 words. But there&#039;s always diligent students who would write more than 20000 words (in Chinese, though).",

      "comment_content": "內容由清朝教到近代中國,用英文黎教中史,好多人名地名都用拼音,查字典既時間比較多<br />Midterm Final都會比定一堆名詞同term你for填充(唔一定係填充,我嗰時話淨係出fill in the blanks點知出左d short question,一個格填幾個字,所以要問清楚), 同埋比定6條short question你準備,會出其中兩題.Long Q既名詞可以用中文寫但fill in the blanks 就唔可以.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof.上堂用ppt教但唔會比你(雖然佢都係照住讀),每個星期都有份note比你上堂去follow(不過係point form既)",
      "comment_grading": "Mean grade大概係C+and B-,唔知點解會係啲鬼佬屈哂機,普遍啲外國人都幾高分(above mean). 記得去check 卷<br />佢話唔使寫得多先攞到高分,要有elaboration就OK,但marking scheme 係分哂point係哂唔同方面分析先攞到分(個結構好似寫到考DSE通識咁就差唔多)",
      "comment_workload": "無咩workload,一個midterm,一個exam,會計attendance 5%(上堂傳紙簽名)",
