    "description": "This course introduces students to human-animal issues such as preserving biodiversity, the wildlife trade, zoonotic diseases, animals as food and medicine, and living with animals in an urban setting. It will also provide a broad historical overview of the animal rights and conservation movements, drawing upon case studies from the US, China, and elsewhere. As this is a postgraduate-level course, students will critically engage with key concepts (biodiversity, animal ethics, etc.), and will also be encouraged to explore new ideas and methodologies for conducting research in human-animal relationships.",
