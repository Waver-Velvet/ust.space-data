    "description": "This course will explore how digital technologies are transforming art production and presentation. From early photography to virtual reality, it will examine art forms at the turn of the mechanical age (e.g. photography, film) as well as artistic practices in the digital age such as virtual reality, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and NFT (Non-fungible token). Situating art and digital culture within a cross-disciplinary context, the course also considers the following key issues: how do digital technologies change our art, culture, and contemporary life? How does art in the digital age define key issues in the digital world such as privacy, copyright, and identity? How can we create art through interdisciplinary practice? Students will learn to analyze new forms of art and related technologies, and to discuss the key issues of the body, identity, and surveillance in the digital age.",
