    "description": "This course is a survey of the history of political, social, economic, and cultural changes in East Asia (mainly China and Japan, and to some extent, Korea) from the 1800s to the 1950s. In the past two centuries, the classical civilizations of East Asia met new challenges: the disintegration of old political systems, the growth of social tensions, and the arrival of an aggressive and expanding West. This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea.",

      "comment_teaching": "The professor&#039;s lecture is very good, and the main content of the class is also very full. <br />The professor will first take the students to browse Twitter for 30 minutes to understand the news that happened in the past week, and then he will take the students to read the PowerPoint. Because it is a history class, it is just like telling a story, and it is very happy to listen to it. The professor has a genuine American accent and uses the right words. The professor&#039;s entire career has been devoted to East Asian history, so there is no doubt about his professionalism. <br />The PowerPoint presentation consisted of the professor&#039;s research results, interviews, and exclusive photographs. Because there is no examination, listening to the lecture will not be under too much pressure. You can really focus on a pure history class, but the professor&#039;s position is very clear. <br /> Sometimes, the lecture will be mixed with some of their own point of view, allowing the two sides to look at it just fine!",

If you do that, there is no doubt increase your workload.<br />But the most difficult thing is the routine summary; it is worth only 2.5% per week, but it can take you 5 hours more to complete, and, you know, it&#039;s weekly!!<br />My advice is that if you do not have enough passion for history or talent for essay, you&#039;d better choose other couse, there must be a course can satisfy your CCC demand!",

He has a deep knowledge of the subject and he could make jokes and comments about history events in class. However, the powerpoints won&#039;t be uploaded to canvas and it has a few words only, assignments are not directly related to the whole course content, which mostly focus on post-1900 events. <br /><br />If you know the events well and has a good histological perspective, you can skip the 3-hours lecture every week.",

      "comment_workload": "A bit huge for a 1000-Core course<br />1. As the reading notes every week could contain up to 8 readings and even you skim through those readings it takes you 5-6 hours to get that 2% per week.<br />2. Book report and film review requires comparison to other literatures.<br />3. Final project requires extensive reading.<br />4. Video editing is fun but may take some time (2-3 days)<br /><br />However, since this is 1000-level course, professor is lenient in giving scores. As long as you submit an assignment with logical arguments and citations, you will get decent grades. :)",

      "comment_content": "The professor takes you through China&#039;s history. There is a brief introduction to how the nation was formed and its relationship with other Asia countries and the West. <br /><br />After giving you some background you take a deep dive into what happened in the 1800th hundred to the present. For students with no background in Chinese politics, history, and culture it is a very fun course to take. It can be considered heavy if you really want to learn every detail and causation between historic actors and events. However, by attending class and taking a few notes you will get the grasp of it.",

Ex. Your grandma might live through a war China had with some country. Interview her and get her perspective of it, along with gathering facts about it.
