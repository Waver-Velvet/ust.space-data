      "comment_teaching": "He is not enabling you to do anything. He does NOT add value to anything. Taking his classes is absolutely a waste of time.<br /><br />More importantly, he has no respect for the students. When the students are presenting, he often interrupts with random useless comments and he does not listen to what the students have presented.<br /><br />I believe the situation is the same for his other courses like Video art, which has even more workload",
      "comment_grading": "HE DID NOT RELEASE ANY SCORE!<br /> So you have no idea about whether the grade you get is reasonable or not. For your own good YOU MUST DO GRADE CHECKING.<br /><br />It took me 3 weeks of emailing back and forth with him &amp; his boss and later I got 2 grade points increase because of his mistake.<br /><br />He is very unprofessional and you can definitely expect many mistakes in the grading process so don&#039;t trust him!!!!",
      "comment_workload": "VERY HEAVY as a common core. You even have to borrow/buy your own camera.<br /><br />70% are group projects (1MT+1final)<br />20% individual research<br />10% attendance <br /><br />For each project, you have to spend at least 2 full days taking photos, then time to edit and making powerpoints and researching. And you have two projects like this",
