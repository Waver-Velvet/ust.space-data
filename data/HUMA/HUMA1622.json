    "description": "How science, technology, and medicine work in the present can be illuminated by a study of their recent pasts. This course is an introduction to those modern histories, presented as a series of case studies. Students will come to understand how science, technology, and medicine are entangled with society and culture. The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others. By the end of the course, students will have a much clearer picture of how science, technology, and medicine are co-produced socially and culturally, and be able to apply those lessons to the world we live in now.",
