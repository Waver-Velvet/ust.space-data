      "comment_content": "As suggested by the course name, this course devotes all of its content to traditional Chinese painting, particularly artistic critique.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry if you can&#039;t draw proper painting or if you didn&#039;t take visual arts in high school at all: I can only draw stickmen, and this don&#039;t affect my grade at all. That said, you should try to reach out for students who have visual art background, or at least a person who understands Western art. This would be useful in your later project.<br /><br />Course outline:<br />1. Introduction<br />2. Early Figure Painting<br />3. The Rise of Landscape Painting<br />4. Monumental Landscapes<br />5. Search for Realism<br />6. Literati Painting<br />7. Southern Song Academy Painting<br />8. Southern Song Chan Painting<br />9. Early Yuan Masters<br />10. The Four Great Masters of Yuan<br />=====Quiz 1=====<br />11. Ming Academy Painting and Zhe School<br />12. Ming Suzhou Literati Painters<br />13. Late Ming Painting<br />14. Qing Orthodox and Individualists<br />15. Early Qing Individualists II<br />16. Qing Court Painting<br />=====Quiz 2=====<br />*The last lecture was reported to be about the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, but apparently Professor Fu didn&#039;t have time to mention them.<br />*There were also 2 guest lectures by Professor Wu Hong (not from HKUST) on late Qing self-portraits and an painter from Hong Kong Baptist University who demonstrated Chinese painting techniques. Their contents were not examinable in quizzes.<br /><br />Also a kind reminder for those who want to enroll in this course in the future. As a non LANG course that can fulfil Chinese language common core requirement, this course is extremely popular among students (or &quot;C-LANG refugees&quot;?)<br />*If you are not in year 4 (and if you are not HUMA student, who have their own quota), please GIVE UP: you&#039;ll probably end up in the waiting list at some 100th or 200th position.<br />*For year 4 students who really want to get into this course, your chance to get into this course entirely depends on careful preparation, mouse clicking speed on SIS and luck.<br />*I was placed at the 6th place of the waitlist initially, and I only get into the course near the end of the add-drop period. Hopefully this can serve as a useful reference when you are waitlisted.",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor Fu Li-tsui&#039;s teaching is probably one of the best in UST, much better than the consistently roasted Chinese LANG instructors. A Taiwanese, her Mandarin/Putonghua accent is impeccable, though you may want to pay extra attention to pronunciation of artist names, like for the artist Guo Xi, I often heard it as &quot;Boxi&quot; (Persia)... Never mind...<br /><br />Answering questions was encouraged and required (for at least 5 times) during lectures. Don&#039;t worry about wrong answers: as Professor Fu would guide you (and the class) to the correct answer nicely and kindly. When Quiz 1 was about to begin, she also calmed us down by suggesting us that &quot;we should probably appreciate these paintings as if they were shown the last time&quot;.<br /><br />Lectures were lively with frequent interactions, though the lecture hall is dark to show the lecture slides containing paintings. Professor Fu was also willing to answer questions after lectures, and I did enjoy discussing some historical backgrounds with her.<br /><br />For the guest lecturers, Professor Wu Hong delivered his bland lecture in awful Kinabatangan MP English, while the HKBU painter delivered her guest lecture in understandable Mandarin. To be honest, the second guest lecture was much more interesting, as we did see how a Chinese painting was created from abstract elements to a recognizable object.",
      "comment_grading": "Class participation: 5% (Full)<br />Class attendance: 9% (Full)<br />Quiz 1: 20% (16.8/20, mean 14.3/20, median 14.4/20)<br />Quiz 2: 20% (16/20, mean 14.19/20, median 14.5/20)<br />Group project presentation: 30% (29/30, mean 26.53/30, median 26/30, low 24/30)<br />Group project written report: 10% (10/10, mean 9.81/10, median 10/10, low 9.5/10)<br />Group project evaluation: 6% (Unknown)<br /><br />Class attendance is mandatory, and unlike some LANG courses that allows some leeway, each absence from lecture deducts 1%, and each absence from guest lectures and group project presentations deducts 2%. Every attempt in answering question in lectures or Canvas discussion board would give you 1% (1% max per each lecture/discussion thread) in class participation. While you only need answer questions for 5 times, answering more questions is certainly interesting in the lecture.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the quizzes, which effectively act as the course&#039;s midterm and final exams, can be demanding to some students:<br />*Quiz 1 was a closed book MC exam with no cheat sheet allowed. The questions would show some cropped out details of paintings and ask related questions like &quot;which of the following(s) is/are created by [artist name]?&quot;. You should prepare for very similar objects being shown on a very microscopic scale. My advice is try to catch every details you can observe: line of sight, position of buildings, and even the background (which may have different level of staining).<br />*The open-book Quiz 2 was about painting critique. There was a short question that gave you an artwork not shown in lecture created by an unknown artist and 3 other known artwork with known artist. Your task was to find out who is the artist based on the similarity and differences. The long question required you to compare two paintings, with subsections asking about differences and similarities before leading you to the overall evaluation.<br /><br />Speaking of the project, this year&#039;s topic was Tradition and Innovation. A 4-5 member group would select a modern artist and compare his/her works with traditional ones to conclude their similarities and differences, to be reported in a 15-minute group presentation and a written report (to be submitted within 1 week after the presentation). As mentioned by someone before, Professor Fu didn&#039;t heavily scrutinize the report, which is reflected in the extremely high mean and median.<br /><br />I was preparing for a B+ to A- grade, but at the end I get an A for this course, which was certainly satisfying with my (and my groupmates&#039;) effort. When compared with Chinese LANG&#039;s Schr√∂dinger grading, HUMA2660 is certainly a stabilizer for your GPA.",
      "comment_workload": "As mentioned in the grading section, Quiz preparation constituted a significant portion of your workload. You should seriously familiarize with the artists&#039; names and their paintings, at least for the course&#039;s first-half (which included some ~40 artists spanning across 5 dynasties!).<br /><br />The project requires you to study a modern artist, so you may want to arrange your groupmates to visit an arts museum or a painting gallery for the purpose of taking high-resolution images. Alternatively, you may need to find painting collections in the library if there is no collection in Hong Kong (which was the case for my group). I was lucky to be grouped with some experienced groupmates, and overall, a 5-member group would divide smaller individual workload, which is true for busy year-4 students.",

The professor will explain different chinese painting techniques and the style of the painters in putonghua. Since she has dimmed the light for us to see the paintings clearly, I have almost fell asleep in every class. If you like Chinese painting, this will definitely bring you some new knowledge.",
      "comment_teaching": "The professor is a really soft-spoken lady. Therefore, if your mandarin is not that good, you may have difficulties hearing what she is talking about. However, she is a very very nice lady, along with the Ta, she is very willing to give you the materials and also suggestions that you need for your group project. And she is very lenient on students.",
      "comment_grading": "Since there are 2 short Quizzes (write a short essay in Chinese and also give you different paintings in a PPT and you have to answer the name of the painters --&gt; MC), presentation of a specific painters and also final paper (which only have to write 500 words for each student), the professor is very very lenient on the grading. I wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;random sentences to &quot;evaluate&quot; a painting, and i got 23/25 for the quiz -__- <br /><br />But there are a lot of Mainlanders in the class. And they basically are really hardworking and very good at putonghua in class. Therefore, dont think about getting an A in the course. But of course, if you want to use this course to avoid the Chinese Language Class, this is the perfect course.",
