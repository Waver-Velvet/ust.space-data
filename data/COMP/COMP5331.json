I have taken COMP 4211/4321/4332 and still find this course interesting. Despite the name of this course, most of the contents are not specific to databases: even if you have not seen SQL before, you can understand this course just fine. Honestly, the title/description of this course should be updated to be less misleading.<br /><br />The difficulty is a bit lower than what you would expect for a PG course. Although there are some theoretical parts, you are mostly expected to learn how to apply the algorithms and perform some calculations. I would say that COMP 4221 (as taught by DY) is more intensive than this. Note: I am now a PG student.",
      "comment_teaching": "Raymond does a good job of explaining the concepts. There are also in-class exercises (not graded) to check your understanding during class.<br /><br />No attendance is required for this course, and the lecture videos are regularly uploaded to Canvas. That being said, there is an incentive to come to class: each person who answers his questions in class will be awarded a coupon. Each coupon can be used to automatically get full marks for one question in an assignment (maximum of one coupon per assignment).<br /><br />Props to the TAs for grading all of our final exam papers over the weekend so that we could check our papers earlier!",
      "comment_grading": "[Grading Scheme]<br />Assignments 30%<br />Group Project 30%<br />Final Exam 40%<br /><br />There are three assignments over the semester. Each assignment contains some questions that require writing proofs and are rather difficult. Make sure you reserve enough time to complete them.<br /><br />The group project (1-6 members per group) can be related to any topic that is covered in class, with some additional areas like NLP to choose from. You can select an existing paper on a topic and, based on that, choose to conduct a survey (80%), an implementation (90%) or research (100%), but the maximum score is capped (in brackets) based on the difficulty of the project. Regardless of this, the project consists of a proposal, final report and presentation.<br /><br />Raymond let us decide on the format of the final exam by polling in class, so it may not be the same in subsequent years. In this year&#039;s exam, some of the questions were virtually the same as the in-class exercises. However, we were given hardly enough time to complete all of the questions.<br /><br />On another note, no detailed marking scheme was provided to us in the solutions of the assignments and final exam, so the number of marks deducted for a given mistake might be arbitrary.<br /><br />[My Grades]<br />Homework: 273/300 (most probably below mean, since most people got 100 marks for any given assignment)<br />Project: Unknown (my group conducted an implementation-based project)<br />Final Exam: 158/200 (Mean: 133.4, SD: 29.7)<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />Without additional statistics, it&#039;s hard to say whether the grading is fair, but A- is just about what I expected.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is average for a PG course.<br /><br />Each assignment will take you around 1-3 full days to complete (depending on how good you are at writing proofs). The assignments are released early (before their contents are covered in class) so time management should not be a problem.<br /><br />On the other hand, the group project makes up most of the workload of this course. You form your groups shortly after the add/drop period and have to submit your proposal by the end of the month. Afterwards, you should start working on the main content of the project, as you have to hand in a final report (similar to a real paper) shortly after the final class of the semester. The presentations are scheduled after the final class and are conducted topic-by-topic. Note that your presentation may be scheduled for Sundays if your topic is too popular (such as NLP) and those who also selected that topic are not free on other days.",
