Probably something you learnt in advance before taking the course.<br />Explicitly, it contains all the old school AI related things, almost no advanced thing.<br />Though the design of the project of using chatgpt to do some research is overall a good idea, the guidance of how to carry the project out is itself misleading and inadequate.",
