      "comment_content": "The content of this course is the most disappointing of course. If you want to learn something solid about software engineering or even some basic software engineering concepts, I am sorry you may find neither of these in the syllabus. The course provides you with the most methodological ideas about how to become a good software engineer, but what&#039;s hilarious is that it will not teach you the ABCs about how to even write a software. (JAVA is included in the lab, very superficial and not structured teaching)<br /><br />After a whole semester of lecture, I&#039;d say I did not learn anything I expected and need to become a good software engineer. If you are required to take this course, I highly recommend that you just SKIP ALL THE LECTURES! I am not being unrespectful, it&#039;s just a genuine advice from your previous CS fellow.<br /><br />The project is the only thing you can actually learn something. You are required to construct a software(game) using java with your teammates. You could take the chance and practice your java and team work skills. Put more effort on this part and try to refine your product, I am sure you will benefit from it, which might also be the only part you can actually learn something in this course.",
      "comment_teaching": "Kenneth is not a good lecturer in my opinion. His teaching attitude is far from satisfactory. He had prepared before-class videos for every chapter, in which you can find countless typos. <br /><br />Of course, we cannot blame the teacher if the content itself is to blame. The thing I&#039;d like to say here is to re-emphasize that the lecture is not helpful at all, and CS students should think of another way to memorize/master the lecture content.",

      "comment_content": "The UML diagram makes us think about the world in a certain way.<br />^ This is an actual answer from an actual quiz.<br /><br />COMP3111H is the exact same as COMP3111, aside from additional requirements in the project.<br />I would like to warn that if you can, don&#039;t take COMP3111 here. Transfer it if you can, or simply don&#039;t take it if you&#039;re not a COMP student. While software engineering is important, this course is not what you seek.<br /><br />A lot of the details of how screwed up the course is, H or non-H, can be found in 151044&#039;s review:<br />https://ust.space/review/COMP3111H/view/aAK2cfIms2IT7bp1ChJTnuiZgcj2q5p4<br /><br /><br />1 - Lecture <br />This course is supposed to teach you:<br />UML Modelling<br />Software Development Methodologies<br />Modelling: Domain and Use-Case Modelling<br />Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements Capture<br />Implementation (Refactoring and Debugging)<br />Testing (Unit, Integration, and Systems)<br />Design Patterns <br /><br />What this course actually taught us:<br />Some resemblance of the above topics, and<br />how incompetent a teaching team can be.<br /><br />Being Kenneth&#039;s course, he incorporates this blended-learning mode, where he reuses videos from previous years to give lectures, has pre-lecture quizzes, and does &quot;in-class exercises&quot; during the lecture periods.<br />I have no comment about arrangement. Whether this works is subject to personal preference.<br /><br />However, I have great doubts about the arrangement of these topics.<br />This is a software engineering course, and there is a programming project. However, useful things for this project, such as design patterns, are taught near/after the deadline of the project. This just seems counter-intuitive. <br /><br />Overall, the lecture topics are just confusing when delivered by Kenneth.<br /><br /><br />2 - Labs<br />The labs are... kinda useless<br />There were a total of 6 labs that needed to be submitted<br />Lab 1- GitHub Basics (very very basic)<br />It was useless. The TAs do not follow normal Java programming practices. You have to copy code provided. Copy, as in manually typing after they included an image of the code. Frustrating, to say the least.<br /><br />Lab 2 - Java Programming<br />They give you a portion of the slides from Desmond&#039;s first lecture of COMP3021, and then tells you to copy badly-written Java skeleton code, then implement something trivial, and doesn&#039;t actually teach Java or familiarize you with it at all.<br /><br />Lab 5 - GitHub Group Repository<br />Project groups are formed at this point. Groups are supposed to create a dummy repository and implement some questionable code. Then we are required to submit a screenshot of a table summarising the division of labour, and commits? I fail to see the point of this as our repository has the TAs as collaborators.<br /><br />Lab 6 - IntelliJ debugger<br />This is the best (or rather, least horrifying and stupid,) lab the course had to offer. They included a bug in the given file, and you&#039;re supposed to fix it. They wrote code in an extremely horrifying manner, which was questionable, but other than that this actually could teach people something.<br /><br />Lab 7 - Unit Testing<br />This was pure garbage. We&#039;re supposed to write tests with JUnit 4 (which is old) , but the given files has JUnit 3, 4 and 5 simultaneously loaded.<br />I have no idea how that even happened and it is, of course, completely unacceptable.<br /><br />Lab 8 - Reflection<br />This is a LANG assignment. We&#039;re supposed to write a short reflection essay on what we learnt from the previously labs.<br />Also completely unacceptable. There is 0 use.<br /><br />3 - Project<br />It was interesting. (derogatory)<br />Imagine a box containing everything you learnt in the lectures or (if any) labs. Now throw them all out the window.<br />Time to use Java (COMP3021) to write a project of a game that utilizes ALGORITHMS (COMP3711). This is not acceptable for a course with COMP2012(H) as its prerequisite.<br />The grading scheme of the project will be mentioned in the grading section of this review.",
      "comment_teaching": "Kenneth&#039;s teaching was subpar, and the rest of the teaching team were incompetent.<br />What the IA/TAs told us to do in the labs and project is opposite of what one is supposed to do/what we learnt to do. <br />From 151044&#039;s review (linked at the content section of the review) you can know more about everything that went wrong.<br /><br />Overall, if you see Eden Wong as the IA, prepare for a world of pain.",
      "comment_grading": "Pre-Lecture Quizzes (5%)<br />In-class Exercises (5%)<br />Labs (10%)<br />Project (20%)<br />Midterm &quot;Quiz&quot; (20%)<br />Final (40%)<br /><br />I find it appalling that the % of the finals is double of the project in a Software Engineering course.<br /><br />The main issue with the grading of the entire course can be summarized with 2 points<br />1 - Subjective<br />2 - Ambiguous<br /><br />Another thing is, programming quality is graded by how the project performs, and not the actual programming in the project.<br /><br />The unit testing part of the project also made no sense. We&#039;re first given a portion of the score after having a line coverage of 20%, but then we&#039;re ranked by our code coverage? And if 2 groups have the same coverage, they&#039;re ranked by a test-to-function ratio that limits both the numbers of tests AND the number of FUNCTIONS in your code. This makes no sense, as you&#039;re telling us not to generalize the same codes and repeat them inside other functions.<br />Not to mention that the whole unit testing score was supposed to be ranked, and we all know ranking in HKUST is a very good idea. (It is not)<br /><br />Overall, I disagree with the marking scheme, and regret suffering for this as it seems like the scheme was designed to trick and keep students in pain.<br /><br />I would like to add that Kenneth has used &quot;give us a real view of the industry&quot; as, perhaps, an excuse to whatever this course was, and I have no comment. <br /><br />I would at least accept it if they knew what they were doing, but it was evident that they did not. Even a UGTA complained about the course management.",

In fact, before the deadline extension, the specification was updated 1 week before. 7 days.<br /><br />I had to take 210 screenshots for the project report, I think I deserve to give this an E.",

      "comment_content": "Supposedly, this course should be an important course for students to learn concepts related to Software Engineering, either in development, planning, or communication. Which in some sense, the course curriculum has indeed covered those important concepts, but also doesn’t make them look like those are important.<br /><br />The course content are the same as those mentioned in the previous reviews, but more or less will be something like:<br /><br />UML modeling <br />Use Case Specification <br />Types of development<br />Design Patterns<br />Some Principles of Development<br />State-Machine Diagram<br />Unit testing <br /><br />and much more that I could not care to remember as they are not that important in the exams and the projects anyways. Like literally the exam mainly testes on your english ability on reading at least 2 long essays consists of at least 600 words during the exam to get diagrams like State-Machine Diagram, Class diagram, Lists of required functionalities or use case diagram right, that you are required to extract every useful stuff regarding to the context provided in the essays AND real life implications.<br /><br />And for some reason, even the course requires the student to have COMP2012/H, a series of, or an accelerated depends of Honors or not, course on OOP with C++ 11/14, the entire course bases on JAVA for god knows why reason. Although Java is a pure OOP language akin to C++ 11/14, it just doesn’t make much sense to justify the prerequisition as you will actually do the programming in Java in labs and a disastrous Project, which is restricted on Java.<br /><br />Oh btw, thank god they have finally decided to use InteliJ instead of Eclipse.",
      "comment_teaching": "Oh, nothing special, as the Prof himself and those who have written a review of this course have mentioned, the course basically taught by reusing pre-recorded videos, which lecturer claimed you can learn most of the stuff by watching the vids in 4x speed, along with preclass quizzes on the content inside the vids. Which frankly speaking, you don’t need watch them as you can just google them anyways.<br /><br />During class of 2 hours long, the main thing you will do is filling in excerise worksheets, and maybe perhaps Kenneth would actually teach something from the .pdf slides. Which frankly speaking, you don’t really need attend them as long as you have a friend take this course with you.<br /><br />Yeah, you can get the gist of how exactly this course works.<br /><br />Oh, if you need help from the TA or lecturer, you might want to join their telegram group. Although sometimes other student of this course will be more useful than the TA and the lecturer anyways.",
      "comment_grading": "I am too fed up with this course too a point that I dun even bother to remember it, but it more or less looks like this in this semester:<br /><br />5%+5% on preclass quizzes and in class exercise <br />10% labs<br />20% midterm quiz<br />20% project<br />40% finals<br /><br />The problem is the project and the labs are handled with a head TA who doesn’t even appear on the SFQ feedback by messing up everything, intended or not, during the course of the course. Almost every amendment made by him were first announced on the Telegram group first, WITHOUT properly inform the other course TAs in the course, before ever releasing an official documented amendment on Canvas. This leads to catastrophic moments where every TA would gives different response and answer towards a change made all in a sudden. <br /><br />The project is on hell of example, where the head TA changed some specification of the project 48 hours before the deadline of the data modeling part of the project on Telegram, and posted the documented of the pdf on Canvas after I don’t remember how long. Which essentially made everyone had to redo at least one part of the data modeling. The grading scheme of the project even changed to a point that it discourage people practising programming decencies in exchange of points. Writing test cases for a developed software is one of the things that you will do to check the correctness of the program, but again, god knows why they decided to make the project score partially inversely proportional to a ratio between test cases and implemented methods. Intuitively speaking, the less test cases with the less methods you have implemented, you can technically achieve more scores. But this also means that you need to throw away the mindset on using private variables/methods in a class on something that is not supposed to be accessed publicly. So many things is wrong on so many level which I don’t even know whether this course is teaching proper software engineering practices and concepts.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload for everything other than the project is minimal, as long as you understand your preclass quizzes and in class quizzes, then you should be alright to midterm and final.<br /><br />The labs are just easy coding to be done within 20 minutes, if they have released a proper instruction with up-to-date instructions related to the IntelliJ software, or instructions without ambiguity that was mainly caused by the Telegram messages.<br /><br />The project itself takes up the 95% of the workload of this course imo, especially I have virtually 0 experience on Java. So you have to self taught yourself with almost everything in Java related to GUI stuffs, and the time you will spend on understanding the hot mess provided by your favourite head TA will be at least longer than the actual time you actually doing the coding.",

For your reference, I started watching the video two days before the two exams.<br /><br />Kenneth actually says why he choose to post the exercise and the video instead of face to face teaching. he said is because the contents are boring since those are all technical terms. Not much skill issue things. But at least update some important things please. The notes were made in 2017 bro. And for the design pattern, actually, you should put more emphasis on this part, there are many more important patterns that are not covered in this course. Those are really the application that we will use in the system or project designing",

If you answer a question wrong, you may already lose 10 marks. <br /><br />average marks for all the exams are high af, like 80 sth. <br /><br />My score:<br />1. 20% project :&nbsp;&nbsp;97/100<br />2. 20% midterm: highest <br />3. 40% final: highest ( not yet appeal and not gonna to, so maybe not after paper checking) <br />4. 10% lab and 10% attendance exercise in Kenneth style: All people should be full <br /><br />Comment: <br />extreme case , self high only to give my marks out <br />exercises provided during the classes are not enough, go internet to do some extra bro.

All stakeholders have their own goal of achieving the projects. Professional software engineering aims to give perfect projects TO receive MONEY. And for people like us , what matters is the grade. Yet, the grading of this project is extremely messy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives a perfect simulation of a real life case. UNCLEAR client requirement, wrong expectation of the product. It really examine our performance in a real life project situation, I will give a credit to this arrangement, it allows me to learn the skills to handle the internal doubt with what to build&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the team and the communication to client in order to ask for clarification of the details of the projects. The most weird part is, it allows us to create some features to the project while fitting the project basic requirement. But those extra features will later bring negative effects on the grading of the project. So should I add those features? Really have no idea. I dont want to just be the critic, try to give a clearer requirements next time AND add more consultation session during the lecture since mostly half of the lecture are wasted in this semester, those time can be the consultation session instead.",

      "comment_content": "Best thing about this course is after the project you will make some great friends. That&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Content: <br /><br />1. Good practices of sotware engineering that you will not use in the project<br />2. UML diagram equivalent to about 5 minutes of Google search<br />3. Use case specification and diagram<br />4. Requirements and testing. This part is actually quite useful, just not useful in reading the question in midterm.<br />5. State machine diagram. A very useful and important concept finished in 10 minutes<br />6. Design patterns. You will probably learn more by watching videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-_1er1mWI",
      "comment_teaching": "The instructor does not make effort to make people listen to him. The classroom is a hot mess; people are minding their own business and the noise makes it impossible to listen to the instructor despite sitting at the first row. I guess that&#039;s why there are online lecture videos on Canvas.",
      "comment_grading": "I hate the project and I hate the marking scheme. The marking scheme is designed in a way that encourages us to do EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE of what is deemed &quot;good practices of software engineering&quot; in class, e.g. refactoring code, using design patterns, writing comprehensive unit tests. Instead, the project marking scheme requires us to minimize our test cases, make every member variable public instead of using get/setters, and discourages code maintainability for the sake of test coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the functions, we are graded based on how few test cases other groups implement (and the penalty is quite heavy too - if you rank the 70% percentile, you final marks will get discounted by 70%). This not only promotes unhealthy competition (I tried asking other groups how to optimize test cases and got a cold reply), but also makes the outcome of our grades very unpredictable. The TA also frequently changes project requirements and only announces important updates on telegram, instead of via email or via canvas.<br /><br />Students are not provided with clear guidelines with how to draw diagrams such as the UML (the instructor essentially brushes it off with saying they will try to be lenient in the grading) but marking turned out rather strict and somewhat arbitrary, and missing a single association in the midterm costs 4% of the total paper. <br /><br />This is on top of the fact that COMP3111 is a COMPULSORY course, and I think all of these combined makes COMP3111H a terrible experience overall.",
      "comment_workload": "If you do not count the amount of java black magic we have to do to get around the marking scheme of the project, then this course has a very light workload. You have to pay consistent effort attending the lectures to get the answers for the quizzes but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Oh yea there is an essay in COMP3111. They decided the best lab task for the lab session about documentation is to write a one-page essay about what have I learned in this course.",

Basically many taught content could be seen in the required element in the project.<br /><br />The course tries to cover the entire lifecycle of software development. It is really hard to cover all of them while giving students some good practice on each topic. I agree that simply study those theories but not actually practicing could lose a lot of effect on learning, but this is hkust&#039;s plan for CS student and all what professor Kenneth is to try to give us everything in a course. I believe Kenneth and the TA spend a lot of time designing the project to let student get as much hands-on experience as possible.",
      "comment_teaching": "It&#039;s blended learning mode: watch video before class and do the lecture exercise during the class. <br /><br />To be honest the slides are hard to study, more specifically the slides are not designed for students to study for the exams.

After revealing the score for the final, I think my letter grade could be between A- to A, but eventually turn out to be A+. If you want to know how the A,B range is distributed, you might need to refer to other posts.<br /><br />My suggestion on getting a good grade is:<br />1. For midterm study quiz questions and beware of important parts in the slide, try to memorize them if possible. Midterm is easy and shouldn&#039;t get a low score<br />2. For project, try to get almost full mark. Many teams get full mark so I believe if you scheduled it well it shouldn&#039;t be hard to get almost full. Apart from following the provided instructions, it is important to build the project in a way that makes sense to you in each part. Eventually there would be a project demo where you need to explain why you design to do something.<br />3. Final: It&#039;s the most important part, there are really long descriptions for the problems for drawing diagrams. To study it&#039;s better to get used to capturing necessary information for each diagram in a long description. I think it&#039;s indeed a little bit based on luck but that shouldn&#039;t influence too much if you study well.",

That is if you attend lectures, you should be able to gain the marks for in-class exercise. <br /><br />Labs:<br />Theoretically, all labs can be finished very fast. Not all labs have to be handed-in. <br /><br />Project:<br />The project doesn&#039;t really help me to understand more about the content of this course. It is a team project (Java) but can finish it in 2-3 days. The most difficult part may be the use of Eclipse (really baddddd). <br /><br />Final exam:<br />Open-book. Hints are given before and during the final exam. I am speechless with the marking scheme, even for the TAs, they can&#039;t explain about the solutions...",

Why are you doing system analysis after testing? This, unless you told me you are not teaching these stages in order, or else it really makes no sense to me.",
      "comment_teaching": "Indeed, Kenneth is generous and tried his best to make us to have a good grade and reasonable amount of A-range as possible. He also tried his best to make the lecture videos with quality in the summer so that we can have a more relax-paced blended learning mode course.<br /><br />Then, onto slides. It is colourful. Just WAY too colourful. Sometimes some unimportant words are highlighted, which can confuse us when making notes. Also, as it is pdf version, the words that are supposed to appear after animation will not be there in the pdf.<br /><br />The TAs. Well, their tips on project are so useful (sarcasm intended). &quot;The truth lies in the dataset, make sure you provide the most COMPLETE and ACCURATE data&quot;, that&#039;s basically what exactly what our TA reiterates every time we asked questions about the project. I think this sentence will forever echo inside my brain.",
      "comment_grading": "Welp, Kenneth is generous with grades. But just *WAY* too generous. <br />This makes the mean *WAY* too high. Especially for exam, Kenneth even give tips on exam. This surely made some stress on&nbsp;&nbsp;us not to make careless mistakes. But who cares? It&#039;s all about guessing and luck because you can&#039;t read Kenneth and the TAs&#039; minds.<br /><br />Grading scheme:<br />Class Quiz: 10%<br />Labs: 10%<br />Class Exercise: 10%<br />Project: 30%<br />Final: 40%<br /><br />My scores are as follows:<br />Class quiz, Labs, Class exercises: 100%<br />Project: 98.5/100 (Mean: ~91.1, SD: ~12.3)<br />Final: 79.7/100 (Mean: ~76, SD: ~6.1)<br />Final grade: A (91.4%)<br /><br />My group lost 1.5 marks in project because we generalized the use case diagram in Activity 1. WTF? That&#039;s what you told us to do in lecture, why do you punish us for doing that?<br /><br />Welp, as you can see the grade is generally good, or is it? Here is my teammates&#039; statistics:<br />Teammate 1: ~90.5% in total =&gt; A-<br />Teammate 2: ~89.4% in total =&gt; B+<br />Yes, I am not joking here. 1% = 1 subgrade??? I don&#039;t know if it is just a special case or something, but it happened. I believe it is because too many people got nearly full mark in everything (except exam, of course), and had a small SD in final, resulting in such a tight grade range.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload I would say it is slightly tight.<br /><br />For quizzes, it is given 2 attempts and the correct answer will be shown. So in fact, student can basically randomly answer the question in the first attempt, and memorize the answer, and answer the correct answer on 2nd try. In fact, we don&#039;t even need to watch the lecture video to do the questions.<br /><br />For class exercises, Holy cow. The time provided is very tight. Especially for students who do their work on paper (i.e. me). Let&#039;s say you were provided 20 minutes to do the exercise, you need to leave about 5 minutes to scan and upload your work. So you actually have 15 minutes to do.<br />Luckily, you don&#039;t have to get the exactly correct answer to get the score. They give you score if you are doing something similar. If so, one can simply randomly draw some diagrams that&#039;s looks like what the question wants and get the score.<br /><br />For labs, they teach you something that are rather simple, like how to make GitHub repo, how to do commit, how to use Eclipse (Though I used IntelliJ in the end lmao), how to code some basic Java, how to make unit test blah blah… Those things are actually easy if you have some basic knowledge on those, like done a project (e.g. COMP2012H), or went for internship before.<br /><br />For project, seriously, I say it is quite cursed. As I said in grading section, my group lost 1.5 marks as a punishment of generalizing the use-case diagram, while the lecture telling us to generalize cases that are too specific. Their borderline on this really shifts back and forth.<br />For the second activity, I must say the scale is small. The workload is about like 3 PAs from Java Programming course combined. Therefore, we can basically done the main core in 2-3 days. We even upload Gantt chart and Burndown chart that is made in like 2 hours by checking against our GitHub commit log, and still get full marks on documentation.<br />Sarcastically, that &quot;truth&quot; within the dataset, according to our TA said, actually means everything. We did not filter out any inaccurate data (e.g. sudden drop in number in &quot;accumulative&quot; data) and still get full mark in source code part. I searched up on the origin of the provided dataset, there already exist some errors like the aforementioned one. Indeed, complete and accurate data is what the client, i.e. the TAs want, but I must say this tip really put me in worry for sometimes.<br /><br />Exam, even though it is open notes, I am totally speechless. Kenneth even give us tips on exam, trivialized some questions on the exam. But still, ambiguity exist in the exam.<br />Firstly, the UML diagram ones, their model answer added multiplicity next to aggregation, while the lecture told us that aggregation already implicitly gave multiplicity so it is not necessary to write it down.<br />The State Machine Diagram question even give a quite misleading instruction, causing most of the students got it wrong (According to TA in-charge) and lose 1.8 marks (Indeed it seems small, but remember it is about 0.3 SD in this exam. It contributes to 0.72% of total grade score and, in this case, may cost you a sub-grade!).<br />These places surely makes the exam itself more than just cursed.",

      "comment_content": "If I have to conclude this course: For those who have Software Engineering experience before may/may not learn something from this course; For those who have no idea what software engineering is, you will still know nothing after this course.<br /><br />Software Engineering is a very interesting topic, unlike Civil Engineering, they may visualise the structure, calculate the forces, stress/strain, and usually they know can the building withstand different shocks in design stage. However, Software Engineering is a completely different topic, there is no single &quot;best structure&quot; to tackle certain problems and usually we cannot foreseen how does the final system behave, or ensure it is bug-free. It is an artwork.<br /><br />However, this course probably was designed in the worst way of teaching Software Engineering, cover everything but not deep enough, not even at a point to understand why I have to do these things.<br />------<br />The Lecture Contents are mainly:<br />1. Modelling Software System<br />This is an important topic, may be it sounds a little bit stupid to draw those class diagram, but it is a way that developers communicate, when you work in the industry with larger system/complicated structure, drawing class diagram is important for communication.<br /><br />2. Software Development<br />Introduction to some software development pattern but too brief, basically if you have not participated in that pattern before, you will not know why it is good/bad.<br /><br />3. System Requirement Capture<br />4. Implementation<br /><br />5. Testing<br />Testing is taught in a dumb way that basically it covers those basic ICT stuff and teach you to draw more diagram. They also teach Integration Testing Using Stub which is very important if you are in Test-Driven-Development, but they omit the important part that is the implementation of Stub (Loosely-coupled principle).<br /><br />6. System Analysis and Design<br />Design Pattern should be the most valuable thing you can learn from this course, some principle like &quot;loosely-coupled&quot;, &quot;composition rather inheritance&quot;... are taught, but only a very brief introduction. BTW his slides is using all the images and derivation of a book: &quot;Head First Software Development&quot; which is a starter-friendly one. Check out this book to learn something valuable.<br /><br />7. Some QA and Management Stuff<br />------<br />Kenneth&#039;s slides are colourful, hard-to-read and vague. You may always find some statement like: &quot;Ignore the inappropriate requirements&quot;. Thanks for that information.<br /><br />I have no big problem with Kenneth&#039;s slides since it is quite hard to cover all important material within 1 semester, it&#039;s fine. However, the arrangement of project is really a mess, I will talk about that in Teaching part.<br /><br />If you do not have any Software Engineering experiences, when you read the slides and attend the lecture, you may think: why am I wasting time for this????<br />Indeed, studying this course without any prior knowledge just like reading a random book written by a random guy, and follow his rules to complete some tasks without any rationale/understanding. But believe me (not Kenneth kind of &quot;believe me&quot;), Software Engineering is a very important topic and it is way more fun than what you experienced in this course.<br /><br />For those who want to take this course (CPEG/ IT minor) and really want to learn solid Software Engineering, don&#039;t register this course, go find an internship instead, it is a waste of time and effort.",
      "comment_teaching": "Let&#039;s start with Kenneth. Kenneth is nice and he always try to please students, that makes this course a bit exam-oriented since he always say &quot;this will be in the final exam&quot;, but still I think he really want students behave well and get good grades (he even provide hints during the final exam).<br /><br />For the TAs, let&#039;s start with the labs.<br />We have 8 labs this year and each lab is teaching something that will be used in the team project. Something like Git and GitHub, JUnit, JavaDoc...etc, but don&#039;t expect to learn Git inside this course, they merely teach you the command to stage/commit/branch/push/clone, without much rationale behind it.<br />I am pretty sure some TAs are not well-prepared because there is some bug during lab7, the TA claim that it works on last year, and finally a student help the TA solve the problem. And the problem is &quot;deprecated module&quot;, sarcastically happening in a &quot;Software Engineering&quot; course.<br /><br />When we have questions about the lab, usually the TAs they are not quite sure about how to deal with it. I guess it may be the problem that they are selecting Eclipse as an IDE, and I wonder who is the genius that come up with the idea using Eclipse for this course. Google: &quot;why Eclipse IDE is bad&quot;, you will know how painful it is doing all the stuff using Eclipse. <br /><br />The next one is Project, I am speechless with this project.<br />The first problem is that the project scale is too small, I am not talking about the number of team members in each team but the tasks we are doing can basically done within 2-3 days, which does not really have to be a Team Project.<br /><br />The next problem is interesting, this course is Software Engineering. So I expect we are doing something like modular development (every teammate do one feature and merge together). However, it is not what the TA expect. When someone asking whether they can use separate controller classes for different tasks, the TA said he suppose us to do all our development inside one class. WTF???? Don&#039;t they know there is something call MERGE CONFLICTS???? No single company will code like this.<br /><br />Finally, in the grading of the project, this course is Software Engineering. So I expect they are checking whether we are doing some Software Engineering Best Practices (comments, organised, easy-to-read code, refactor code...). But NO, they don&#039;t look at the source code, as long as your application is working and you submit all the requirement documents, you are good to get full points. WTF??<br /><br />Every Team has a TA as Team coach, but actually the team coach is not necessary except you can ask about his/her grading criteria, that&#039;s it.<br /><br />So what is the point of doing this project???",
      "comment_grading": "---Update after grade release---<br />To be honest, this should be the most &quot;good grade&quot; course in CSE department, of course here my definition is the overall grading instead of whether the grade reflects ability/hard work, scoring mean in this course yields B/B+, me personally get mean in exam, project slightly above mean but I miss 1% in quizzes. Total score of 88.xx% that leads to a B+ grade which is unexpected.<br /><br />However, it is still worth mentioning the exam format.<br />This year Kenneth tries to avoid ambiguity, so instead of drawing the whole class diagram, he gave a skeleton diagram and we fill in the multiplicity into it. There are several reading comprehension, weird questions and ambiguous questions.<br /><br />When I am doing the exam paper, I feel so disappointed, feeling like an idiot fooled by others to take an exam of searching stuff from notes (the exam is open-notes), reading passages to fill in the blanks, and draw a state-diagram to some &quot;SOFTWARE SYSTEM&quot; which is just a vending machine. I want to give up the exam several time as it really does not examining anything. If you ask experienced FAANG Software Engineer to take this exam, believe me, they will also get the mean mark.<br /><br />They release scores for individual problems, and this is the first time that I get every single questions so close to mean. Not only me but also my friends, everyone is getting similar scores on each problem. The reason behind this is that TAs are just following Kenneth&#039;s marking scheme, and his marking scheme is crazily picky and not reasonable. In the appeal section, one TA also thinks that our consideration is correct, but Kenneth just don&#039;t think it is necessary, the TA has to follow the marking scheme and give out points.<br /><br />The course is a good grade course in the sense that, every person gets the same score, the s.d. of final exam is around 6 out of 100, which is super crazy for a COMP course. Kenneth does keep his promise to maximize A/B ranges, and put as much B+/A+ as possibles. That makes 88% gets B+ but 92% gets A+.<br /><br />For those A-rangers, it is a hard course to get A, but if you are just an average person and don&#039;t mind learning nothing, register this course.",
      "comment_workload": "This course has basically no workload, or if you compare it with other courses, it worth at most 3 credits.<br /><br />Out of those 3 credits, 2 credits come from Eclipse. <br />It take you some time to boot up the whole IDE, and when you add some files into the workspace folders, you are very likely not to see them in the IDE. Then you have to shut down Eclipse and open it again. No Auto-Complete means that you have to type every fxxking character. When you edit some code you try to see its effect, it takes Eclipse some time to figure out the build gradle file, and run the gradle project. And there is a very high chance to fail since you did not set up the build path correctly. What is buildpath?? Sorry, it is not taught in labs. Find the solution yourself.<br /><br />When you face some problem in Eclipse and try to StackOverflow, usually there is no question asked for your problem cause any sensible programmer would not use Eclipse IDE anymore. If you can find something, there is a high chance that the answer is: it is the intrinsic design problem of Eclipse, remove all folders from workspace and restart Eclipse.<br /><br />There can be so many cool things that this course can do, e.g. Remove all the lectures and focus on one big project. The team coach guide you to finish each tasks and teach you some Software Development Practices, also your team can choose a development pattern you like. Having meeting with Teach Coach every week to report progress and ask for suggestions. Finally, assessment based on the practices used, the way the team tackle problems...<br /><br />Of course there are still a lot of ways that this course can be conducted, just not the current way.",

Also, they never tell you what you&#039;ve done wrong. They won&#039;t even give you a comment and sometimes your score is even missing. When you send an email to ask for a comment, they just ask to appeal. Seriously??? After appealing, they told me that I got 0/10 for commendable features. lol wtf.

But in turn, correct diagrams are not necessary, Kenneth just wants to see that you have attempted the exercises. Not only that, Kenneth usually shows and explains what a model answer might be, so if you are lazy, you can wait and just copy his diagram.<br /><br />The project requires a bit of coding, should be easy if you have any knowledge of programming. If you don&#039;t they&#039;ll teach you all you need to know in labs so don&#039;t worry.<br /><br />The final exam was open-booked, but most of the questions required you to determine whether the given diagram was drawn correctly, and asked you to drawn what you think is the correct diagram if you think the given diagram is incorrect. Since interpretation can play quite a big factor when deciding how a diagram should be drawn, be prepared to appeal if you think your diagram was wrongly graded.<br /><br />All in all, this course is one of the easier courses in UST in my opinion, and if you have the opportunity to have Kenneth as your lecture, you should pick him.

Regarding the diagram drawing lecture<br />Kenneth is quite interactive in this regard to answer students&#039; questions, but this is just because his standard on diagram drawing is just so ambiguous and students have many questions on his standard or perspective. Honestly, even after hearing all his clarifications, I don&#039;t still quite get what he actually wants.<br /><br />2. Regarding the powerpoint reading lecture<br />Well, I must say, sometimes he did clarify some points he is previously reading. But most of the time, he is just reading aloud, &quot;with a smile&quot;, just like what other reviews have mentioned.<br /><br />3. Exam-oriented?<br />&quot;Class diagram is important, because I guarantee that there will be one question in the final exam asking you to draw class diagram&quot;<br />&quot;You should pay attention to use-case diagram, because I guarantee that there will be one question in the final exam asking you to draw use-case diagram&quot;<br />&quot;You better understand what is state-machine diagram, because I guarantee that there will be one question in the final exam asking you to draw state-machine diagram&quot;<br />&quot;You should practice drawing flow graph, because I guarantee that there will be one question in the final exam asking you to draw a flow graph&quot;<br />Does he imply that these things are useless when he didn&#039;t test these in exam?<br /><br />4. Do you want good grade?<br />&quot;Do you want tips on the exam? Do you want me to give out better grade?&quot; asked Kenneth during exam review, with a BIG smile. Unfortunately, I personally dislike his way of asking these questions.<br /><br />Even though I am being quite critical here, his teaching is actually better than average (I would leave you to judge whether his teaching is exemplary). I also see Kenneth&#039;s and Nam Kiu&#039;s (the TA) effort in trying to help us as much as possible, where they open a Telegram group for students to ask about the project or anything, and they attempt to prevent freerider from ruining other members in the project.",
      "comment_grading": "First 50% = In-class ex. + Lab + Project<br />Easy marks. Some review said the project is just a COMP2012H assignment. I don&#039;t agree. I would say that the project is even easier than a COMP2012 assignment, just that you need to self-learn JavaFX, JUnit and Javadoc, but for the purpose of the project, they are not difficult at all. (Well, the caveat is you have experience in C++ in COMP2011+2012/2012H.)<br /><br />Another 50% = Final Exam<br />Well, this is the interesting part. First thing first off, this is a game of pure luck. There is basically no use to review the lecture notes or the in-class exercise (except the MC questions where you have the exam review to refer to), because they didn&#039;t give you sufficient evidence to judge Kenneth&#039;s standard on diagram drawing, or inferring functionality and requirement. This also means that it makes no sense to talk about the difficulty of the exam, since you are literally doing guessing in the 2 or something hours.<br /><br />This leads to the second thing: everyone&#039;s mark is just so concentrated. It&#039;s like 5X to 7X marks out of 95. Everyone is just guessing. You get a slightly higher mark because you are a slightly better guesser, not because you know slightly better the course material. I also remembered one question in the exam is autograded. What is the consequence? You just see a whole column of 0s for that question in the mark sheet given out by Kenneth. Really fucking interesting.<br /><br />And that leads to the third thing: there is no point talking about the mean or SD. Your grade is determined by your rank in the exam, and the rank is determined by your luck. Because of this, I would give a &quot;D&quot; in this grading column.<br /><br />But I decide to give out a &quot;C&quot; for this column instead, because Kenneth&#039;s grading distribution is really lenient.<br />First 50%: got 49.1% (I lost that 0.9% just because my use-case specification does not include an alternative flow)<br />Second 50% (final exam): 65/95 (so that I rank 20 out of 100 something students)<br />Grade: A<br /><br />However, I won&#039;t speak in favor of this course&#039;s grading scheme just because I got the second best grade possible, since I don&#039;t really know how the marks are earned or lost in the exam, and I don&#039;t think it is reasonable when your luck is a decisive factor of your grade. (Remember his COMP2711, when your carefulness decides your grade?)",
      "comment_workload": "When Kenneth&#039;s COMP2711 is a 4-credit course with 2-credit workload, then his COMP3111 is a 4-credit course with 3-credit workload. Here is the main workload:<br /><br />1. Attend his lesson to gain access to his in-class exercise, and finish the exercise<br /><br />2. Labs: as I have mentioned, each lab can be finished within half an hour, assuming you didn&#039;t encounter any technical problems<br /><br />3. Project<br />The project just gives a taste of how it feels when you code with others. It is not complex enough to render those design pattern or testing things useful, and it is quite fine even when you write sphagetti code or create a god class. The main workload actually comes from self-learning JavaFX, JUnit and Javadoc, if you didn&#039;t take COMP1022P or COMP3021 before.<br /><br />4. Exam<br />It just didn&#039;t deserve your time of revision.<br /><br />Indeed, the course does have a bit of workload when you need to manage your project and meet the deadline, but in terms of a software engineering course, this workload is just nothing, because the project scale is small. The &quot;A&quot; for this column is given under the context of a software engineering course.",

Just because all other CSE courses in HKUST are about coding and programming, none of them taught you how to effectively write a program.<br /><br /><br />This course teaches you “how” to write a software, but not only “what” to code. I mean you are still nothing even you learnt all syntax and algorithms, if you don’t know how to systematically write a large program. “When you enter the industry, you eventually want to be a manager”, said Kenneth, which is indeed very true. No one wants to be a programmer for the whole life without being promoted to the managerial level.",
      "comment_teaching": "Not good and not bad. He teaches with reasonable efforts and speaks clearly. Sometimes students may ask some advanced questions that make Kenneth utters.

This year the mean is quite low, maybe due to online. Mean for final around ~ 58-60 (not disclosed but we can see the scores for all students)<br /><br /><br />Final grade: A+ !!<br />Kenneth is really lenient in grading.",
      "comment_workload": "I would say is appropriate. Given it is 4-cred.<br /><br /><br />You will need to spend some efforts to deal with the graded labs, the project may take some time if you are not familiar with Github, Java and Javafx. If you came from 1022p instead of 1021/1022q, it may be better.<br /><br /><br />For the final exam, you can only prepare for the Multiple Choices that Kenneth gives out during the exam review section, other questions are really luck cuz you won’t know how it is marked. Better to revise yourself with English reading comprehension skills cuz you will face thousand-word problem statements.... In my opinion, the exam is nothing about Software Engineering, it does not worth your precious exam-period time to study too much for this course.",

This course is more like Software Project Management 101. There&#039;s a lot of &quot;what are the different types of requirements&quot;, &quot;how do you turn this vague description of a system / procedure into a diagram that no one really reads in real life&quot;, &quot;what counts as a state? Or is it a transition?&quot;, weird stuff like that.<br /><br />It covers some technical things like testing and oop design patterns, but in a very superficial way.",
      "comment_teaching": "Speaking for 2711 as well. Kenneth Leung seems like a genuine nice person, but god do I hate his courses.<br /><br />1) His slides are very hard to read, especially for the easily distracted! There&#039;s no consistent structure! No alignment! Too liberal use of bold, italics, underline, and animations! And COLORS! A pride parade is less vibrant compared to his slides.<br /><br />2) He always makes the assessments way too easy, for &quot;our benefits&quot; he claimed. Some questions are copied verbatim from the revision exercises. So the mean is absurdly high. In the end, I feel like we are punished for making careless mistakes, rather then for being poor at software engineering.<br /><br />3) Sorry, this is personal. Something about the way he talks makes me wanna whack him. He tries too hard at making mundane stuff sounds cute or interesting.",
      "comment_grading": "I will preface by saying that I skipped classes A LOT, and didn&#039;t revised for the final (out of self-destruction, and disgust for this course). I deserve the B+. But still, here comes my wall of rage.<br /><br />Full marks on everything except the final where I got 71/100 =&gt; B+. FUCK! I have a friend who also received full marks for everything else and 80.5/100 for final, and he got A+. So, it&#039;s like, what, total marks 85 = B+, 90 = A+ !!? This is not a reasonable reflection on students&#039; performance.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Be careful with Kenneth Leung&#039;s courses. He makes everything so freaking simple, everybody got full marks, and in the end losing a few marks due to silly mistakes for the final with cost you a letter grade.<br /><br />PARTICIPATION (full mark): <br />Just hand in 12 in-class exercises and you&#039;re done.<br /><br />LAB (full mark):<br />Basic Java programming. Basic Git usage. Very straightforward, each can be completed within half an hour.<br /><br />PROJECT (full mark):<br />Basically make a desktop app. If you are comfortable with Java and GUI programming this is simple. The &#039;documentation&#039; part is a no-brainer. They don&#039;t even care about the quality. As long as it&#039;s there and it kind of make sense then you will get full mark.<br /><br />FINAL (71/100; weighted 50%; around mean)<br />MC worth about 30% of the paper. Kenneth will give you the questions and answer as revision exercise before the final.<br /><br />The rest are utter mess! Ambiguous load of crap. They are long version of various in-class exercises. Usually involves drawing flow-chart like diagrams, and categorizing the components of problem statements. There are no unique solution! Different people can interpret the statements differently. To give you a feeling: during the final, people are raising their hands requesting for clarification non-stop for 3 hours. The girl in front of me raises hers &gt; 10 times. And only Kenneth is answering because the TAs are just as confused. During the paper checking session, people were swarming the TAs and the assistant professor trying to explain why they think their answer is right.<br /><br />This course is NEVER about realistic software engineering practices, it&#039;s all about EXAM TECHNIQUES. So be sure to attend the classes to get a feel of what Kenneth wants.",
      "comment_workload": "Doesn&#039;t feel like a 4-credit course. <br /><br />Most of the workload comes from the project. Whether it is heavy or not HIGHLY depends on your coding skills. Three areas that may be new to people coming from only COMP1022* and COMP2012 are 1) GUI library (JavaFX) + MVC pattern; 2) Java threads; 3) Git. Learning and debugging the first two IMO can be quite time consuming.<br /><br />See GRADING for further break down.",

You have to think about the structure, and you have to think about how to build a good UI, and much more. After Kenneth have revamped the course, the project becomes like like an COMP 2012(H) assignment, you just copy and modify some things in skeleton code. You can attain full marks without considering any design patterns or OO concepts, or even with spaghetti code. (you won&#039;t get penalized for bad code!)

If you draw the thing that he expected, then you will get the mark. But you can never guess the marking scheme because there are insufficient examples to judge that. The only thing you can do is memorize all the MCQ Kenneth gave and the three principals of the design pattern (you must use the EXACT wording from the in-class exercise to get the mark!).<br /><br />In-class exercise: 10/10<br />Labs: 10/10<br />Project: 30/30<br />Final exam: 90/100 (Mean: ~70, SD: ~10.8, Max: 91.5) =&gt; 45/50<br />Overall: 95/100 =&gt; A+<br /><br />My grade is probably not that useful for judging the grading scheme.

Having a good groupmate, especially one that keep track of the progress and requirements well, do help quite a bit. Conversely, if you got a freerider, you still have to do some of the group stuff by yourself like the unit test and coverage.<br /><br />For exam preparation, recite the MCQs Kenneth gave (he claimed all MCQs are from the review, but somehow some of them aren&#039;t) and the three design principal of design pattern (that three points in the in-class exercise).

There was way too much theory. <br /><br />UML Modelling<br />Development<br />Requirements Capturing<br />Implementation<br />Testing<br />Analysis &amp; Design<br />SQA<br />Project Management<br /><br />A lot of it is very relevant though if you plan on working a tech job. <br /><br />The Project is worth 50% and uses Java (thank lord not ASP). There will be some DIY tutorials for it, but it is very easy to do intuitively learn it. Github tutorials are the ones you need to pay good attention to. Thanks to this course, I have finally gotten around to learning it, and it is something that you will definitely use in the future.",

You can do it then, or if you didn&#039;t pay attention, bring it to next class and copy the solutions. These exercises help a lot for the final though, so might as well pay attention. You only need to do about half of them. <br /><br /><br />Labs - 10%<br />Quite easy, follow it yourself labs. I wished they would be more to learn. <br /><br />Project: <br />Project SIgn Up - 2%<br />Activity 1: System Requirements Specification - 15%<br />Simple UML and Use Case diagram<br /><br />Activity 2: System Implementation &amp; Testing - 30%<br />A full-fledged Java project with GitHub integration. <br /><br />Meeting Minutes and Gannt Chart - 3%<br /><br />Final Exam - 30%<br />The professor will give the MCQ questions, learn them well. <br />Rest will be a lengthy yet easy exam, the professor will tell you what type of questions will come so that you don&#039;t need to focus much on the theory. But mean was quite high. <br /><br />Got full in everything<br />Project - 46/50 (should have done the unit testing)<br />Exam - 85.4/100 (mean 79.9)<br /><br />Got B+, pretty happy, if only our team had tried to do something about the unit testing in the project, would have been A.

The entire process of developing software is covered, from gathering requirements all the way until the acceptance testing.

I took the Fred one, but also learnt a lot about the Kim one.<br /><br />Common:<br />Software design principles and patterns.<br />Software development workflows.<br /><br />The common things are basically memorization, like most of the COMP courses in UST.<br /><br />Fred: lab and project is ASP.NET WebForms website. You learn latest C#, T-SQL and write a somewhat complicated website to satisfy a long and vague requirement document. Closer to large, old, non-Internet enterprises in the real world.<br /><br />Kim: lab and project uses latest frontend libraries (e.g. ng), No-SQL db and Java to build an app with both web and Android clients. You have more freedom (and obligation) to show your creativity. Closer to newborn, Internet enterprises.",

There is good reason for each point you lose in your project (output does not match requirement). Although the requirement statements are vague, you can clarify them with dozens of emails during the semester. In other words it is possible to get full mark in project if your group programs well.<br /><br />Kim: TAs&#039; taste will have a big impact on your grade. How is your poster? How is your unique feature? What&#039;s your effort of implementing if you use another library? These subjective things can lead to rather unfair outcomes. To make things worse, different TAs have different standards because they did not get on a common ground before grading (Fall, 2015-16). And the professor did not participate.",

Even better, find people with prior software development experience to avoid the entire team running into troubles.<br /><br />Exams are easy, but some questions feel like lottery.

You can learn how to use git, how to do testing, how to work with your teammates and some software development tools such as Slack and Github.<br /><br />You have to know the format of final presentation.<br />For example:<br />If you just present using a video, you should not spend much time doing validation and backend stuff because no one will check your code and see if your codes are good or bad. You should do your layout beautiful and create more gimmick things.<br />I waste more time on improving code structure and work flow but no one cares them. (We thought the format was REAL DEMO)<br />(Remark: At least 2 presenters in your group)<br /><br />If you want to get a good grade, <br />- Memorizing the lecture notes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(examples and definitions) is needed. <br />- Go to Review Lecture. <br />- Get Full lab points<br />- Get Full marks in Assignments<br />- Try to get Bonus points if you have time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(But it is very difficult)<br /><br />I hope these opinions can help reduce your workload because you can allocate time efficiently.

It is just like an early final, accompanying the assignment, the two deadlines at the end of the semester are perfect for killing your passion in pursuing to be a software engineer.<br /><br />The assignment is the KILLER. First, Microsoft. Second, god damn laggy visual studio. Third, god damn ASP.NET. Who the heck still use ASP.NET? I heard that the Fall sem 3111 was using Node.js....interesting...<br /><br />In short, if you like &quot;legacy thing&quot;, Spring. &quot;New thing, energetic?&quot; Fall. &quot;Meh, I don&#039;t even know what ASP.NET and Node.js is&quot; Fly!
