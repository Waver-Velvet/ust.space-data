    "name": "Modern Compiler Construction",
    "description": "Compiler implementation techniques are relevant to a wide array of software engineering areas. From parsing ad-hoc configuration file formats to validating complex specification languages to generating efficient code solving data-intensive problems at scale, many important problems of today and tomorrow require knowledge of basic compiler technology. The course exposes students to the essentials of modern compiler construction, including parsing, semantic analysis, program transformation, and code generation. Students will learn to design and implement their own programming language and extend it with a feature of their choice in a small team project. The course focuses on achieving these goals through effective high-level programming techniques, whose mastery will also make students a better programmer in general.",
