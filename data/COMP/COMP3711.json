I once thought this course was past paper analysis instead of a certain math course that most ppl scared about it.<br /><br />Final probably isn&#039;t a past paper analysis, but I guess one knows BFS, DFS with some common sense and 2711 can already finish 90% graph questions in the final and getting most of the points.<br /><br />Overall, I would say the assignments are harder than the exams.<br /><br />Notice!!! everyone here would be either a genius or a future mathematician but please don&#039;t get discouraged. The assignments are hard af and ppl still managed to score 100 for them, everyone in this class is too good. I got all below mean except for the first one:). Assignment questions essentially are IQ puzzles, so maybe just I am an idiot.<br />But the good thing is that even for a dump person like me can still get A range in this course, so this course grading is actually super good and generous. Highly recommend ppl to take this course and get some good grades even if you are not a CS major, like me :)",

Also since he always stimulate us to think (and solve those &#039;IQ questions&#039;) his class is not boring at all. <br /><br />The lecture is a perfect balance of intuition and rigorousness, in the sense that you can easily get the main idea, while not losing too much rigorousness. <br /><br />Most of the TAs are Phd students/candidates, I think they wrote the HW solutions, which are pretty clear and smart. They&#039;re also patient and willing to listen to your arguments.",
      "comment_grading": "I&#039;m likely ~10 marks below the high, still get same grade as him/her, very lenient !<br /><br />Some mistakes I made in exam, hopefully it can help you:<br /><br />1. run time comparison: looks simple, but can be very tricky e.g. they mix big Omega, big O together. I drew conclusion too fast, lost 8 marks.<br /><br />2. initial call: built a function f(i,j), but didn&#039;t tell TA what&#039;s the initial call e.g. f(1,n), lost 2 marks<br /><br />3. brief explanation: designed a greedy algorithm, but didn&#039;t fully explain the rationale behind, lost 3 marks<br /><br />4. read question carefully: not just me, in final many classmates also miss read S&#039;\\subset (V \\ S) as S&#039; = V \\ S. All of us gave the same (totally) wrong algorithm ... <br /><br />Exam can be stressful, try your best to control yourself",
      "comment_workload": "HWs were quite challenging to me, but it&#039;s ok, no challenge no fun. Now I&#039;m very glad that I faced those challenges, didn&#039;t give up and learned a lot.<br /><br />Here&#039;re some tips for HW which may be helpful:<br />1. easy to hard: HW are on the hard side, you may not want tackle them immediately when you just learned a new topic. Try practice on easier questions first to gain some experience and level up.<br /><br />2. lecture: review lecture/slides/tutorial, there&#039;re maybe some surprises :)<br /><br />3. research: You may be able to find solutions to similar problems or related theorems in journals, which may give you more ideas. This may be much more time consuming than you think, since you need to understand and analyze huge amount of information. I only recommend this a last resort because most of the time the solution is much simpler.<br /><br />The exams were much easier, but you need to make sure you&#039;re very familiar with materials in lecture, slides and tutorials. There&#039;s a high chance similar questions (or their extensions) will appear.",

(because he doesn&#039;t want to reveal too much in his conceptual questions) <br /><br />He tried to make some jokes during lectures occasionally e.g., &quot;two-child policy&quot; in the correctness of huffman-encoding. He also repeatedly asked us to not think about algorithms during DP lecture in the course &quot;Design and Analysis of Algorithms&quot;.<br /><br />The PowerPoint of both lecture and tutorial are very-well designed like all COMP courses.

It&#039;s certainly ok for you to do so since the course has nothing to do with C++. What you need is a little bit of &quot;mathematics sense&quot; and a basic idea of what complexity means. I also don&#039;t think COMP2711/2711H is any helpful to this course so you may waive that as well if you are really interested in taking this algorithm course in year 1. COMP2711/2711H is more helpful for COMP5711/5712.<br /><br />4 assignments throughout the semester. Some problem in assignment is quite difficult and may take you some time to figure out. On average, each assignment takes me about 5 hours to finish (most of the time is spent on formatting latex). I got almost full marks in asm1-3 except I always forgot to state the running time of some trivial algorithms. I also run binary merge tree wrong in asm4. That causes quite a lot of marks so you need to be careful and double-check your assignments since mean is usually around 80-90%.<br /><br />Both mid-term and final exam is of moderate difficulty but time is quite limited. The TAs is lenient on marking though. You don&#039;t need extremely rigorous proof. I tried to give formal proofs in mid-term, ending up not having enough time to finish some easy problems.",

It is very hard to get the core idea of algorithms if you just follow his lecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;His lecture will only get you familiar with each algorithm and academic terms, but you really need to work harder by yourself after a lecture to gain a more insightful understanding. So my suggestion would be not even attending his lecture. Besides, the midterm problems set by him are more of a testing of reading and understanding of English than actually solving the algorithm problem: a single problem itself is more than 1 page long! I don&#039;t know why he did this to us, because as far as I know, only a few students taking this course are actually English native speakers. Dimitris teaches pretty well although he is not an expert in algorithm study,&nbsp;&nbsp;it&#039;s worth attending his lecture.

      "comment_content": "Among all CS compulsory courses, this one(3711) and COMP2011+12/2012H, in my opinion, are proboably the most important courses. The content of COMP3711 basically never changes since it&#039;s about &quot;classic algorithms&quot;, not the ML or DL algorithms that could be changing and developing everyday nowadays. <br /><br />Main Topics:<br />~ The idea of divide and conquer<br />~ The idea of greedy algorithm<br />~ Dynamic programming (1D/2D/interval)<br />~ Graph algorithms (from BFS/DFS to shortest paths)<br />~ Max flow problems<br /><br />From my perspective, &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;DP&quot; are about getting the idea, or the approach of thinking, while Graph algorithms really seems like a game of memorization, well at least I wasn&#039;t smart enough to figure out any &quot;generic&quot; idea behind them.",
      "comment_teaching": "Ever since entering ust and getting into CS major, I have been imagining taking this course from Prof Golin, because every rumor I heard about Golin is about how clear his teaching is. And I know he normally teaches this course. And also most rumors I heard about prof Papadias is how weird his accent is and how difficult it is to follow his lectures. So at first when I saw it was prof Papadias who was going to be the course instructor this semster, I was very disappointed and really wanted to drop the course. <br /><br />But it turns out that Papadias&#039;s teaching is just great! Yes, he has a strong greek accent, but it&#039;s absolutely undestandable, it&#039;s even easier to follow compared to the Chinese accent of some professors I think. Aside from the accent, everything else is very clear. He explains each concept clearly and in an organized manner, he also give plenty of examples to help us understand. And despite this was an online semester, he fully utilized the zoom chat to make the lecture as interactive as possible. I haven&#039;t really taken a course from Golin, but if all rumors about how good Golin&#039;s teaching is are true, I think Papadias&#039;s lectures are every bit as good as Golin&#039;s lectures.<br /><br />But there are two major difference between Papadias and golin&#039;s style. (See Grading and Workload section)",
      "comment_grading": "Usually if Golin is the only instructor of this course or coteaching this course with other instructors, golin will be the course coordinator, that means he gets to decide grading scheme. And Golin&#039;s style is to give a so called &quot;guarantee grading&quot;. (you may probably find the details about this in comp3711 review on Golin) And that &quot;guarantee&quot; is a &quot;lower bound guarantee&quot;, so as long as your overall score is high enough, you can secure an A range. But when Papadias is the only insturctor of the course (and hence the course coordinator), he doesn&#039;t have this &quot;guarantee&quot; scheme. Instead, it&#039;s pure curved grading. <br /><br />And it turns out that because the final exam is much easier this semester, the mean reached an astonishing 80 (which is probably never seen in comp3711 history I think), with an sd of 17. The mean of the final was even higher than many of the homework asignments. <br /><br />But despite that, since Papadias already gave an A range of 25%,&nbsp;&nbsp;which is normally the largest A range allowed according to ust policy (Bad Guy UST, why not allow for more A), I should say the grading of this course (at least this semester) is very good.<br /><br />And I also heard that the mean is B, while Golin claimed his mean is usually C+/B-, which is &quot;standard ust&quot;, quoted from Goin.",
      "comment_workload": "&quot;The workload of comp3711 is isane&quot;, this is what I heard for a thousand times before taking this course. However, the workload was ideed not small, but not that &quot;insane&quot;. <br /><br />This is probably another important difference between Golin and Papadias&#039;s style. Golin emphasizes a lot on proofs. He has a very standard and strict requirement on writing rigrous proofs for many kind of algorithms, which could often end up in pages. But Papadias has an more &quot;algorithmetic focus&quot;. He doesn&#039;t focus that much on proofs, but instead on the intuition and design of algorithms. So Papadias&#039;s assignments are lengthy, but the difficult part is about coming up with the idea of the algorithm, not writing pages of long and rigorous proofs. So the workload is actually smaller than I imageined.",

You will learn about how to calculate the space-time complexities of different algorithms.<br />This course should be very important for those who want to apply for ibank internships or start your journey of LeetCode, as all the fundamentals are taught in this course. We do not have COMP3711H this year. Therefore it may be better if you study this course in Yr2 Spring if you really want to get a job in the Fall recruiting season.<br /><br />1. Divide and Conquer, different sorting.<br />Introduction of different sorting algorithms. Learn how to use recursion to deal with problems. Some other sorting algorithm like quicksort, heapsort, linear sort are also taught.<br /><br />2. Greedy<br />Be greedy and take the best one among all choices in each steps, but...how do you define &quot;best&quot;? Very hard to proof its correctness, usually simple in implementation.<br /><br />3. Dynamic Programming<br />Very powerful tool that usually performed in optimization problems. Bottom-up approach of building up solutions compared to divide and conquer (top-down approach). The recurrence relationship will be key in this topic.<br /><br />4. Graph algorithms<br />BFS, DFS, Minimal Spanning Trees (Prim, Kruskal), Shortest Path algorithm (Dijkstra), Max-Flow-Min-Cut theorem, Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.<br />The Max-Flow-Min-Cut is the best thing I learnt in this course, an effective tool solving many other problems.<br /><br />5. AVL Trees<br />Balanced BST. Relatively easy.<br /><br />6. String Matching (Finite-automata)<br />How does the computer do searching when you ctrl-F?",
      "comment_teaching": "Golin is quite good in teaching these things but he just explains something easy by a harder mathematical language.<br /><br />Every lesson, he speaks relatively slow, but as the class progress, he get excited and speaks faster and faster which takes you more and more effort to understand what he is talking about.<br /><br />He taught great before Graph Algorithms, but once he starts Graph Algorithms, he start messing a little bit, somehow he speaks too fast that makes a lot mistakes and has to speak again. He always said: &quot;ignore what I said in the last minute.&quot; and starts again. Maybe you can go the other section at this topic.",
      "comment_grading": "This year because there is no COMP3711H, the mean and median is relatively high (also related to final format, see in workload session) and seems like the teaching team do not adjust the grading for that, which makes it is very hard to get A/A+.<br /><br />But the teaching team promise a lower bound for grades:<br />90 or above get A range<br />80 or above get B range<br />70 or above get C range<br /><br />The grading part:<br />50% assignment (1 PA, 5 written assignments)<br />50% final exam<br /><br />Me:<br />Assignment: 594/600 (the mean for each assignment is around 80-90 but median is around 90+)<br />Final: 93/100 (mean 69.2, median 75)<br />Total: 95.8/100<br />Grade: A",
      "comment_workload": "The workload depends on your mathematical background, compare this course to those strict, rigorous math courses (e.g. MATH2033), this course is relatively loose in grading our proofs. Usually you still get full marks in your assignments/exam if you leave a bit loophole in your proofs (even one time I know my proof is not complete, but the TA still give full marks).<br /><br />The assignment 1 will be a big bomb for those who doesn&#039;t know how to write proofs, as somehow it requires a bit mathematical background to finish those upper bound/lower bound proofs (limit of sequences, epsilon-delta will help a lot).<br /><br />As the course progress, the assignments are easier, it no longer need an a-ha moment, but simply something covered in class.<br /><br />For the final exam, I am disappointed by its format, being a past-paper analysis course. There is one question from last year past paper directly, and mainly the proof questions comes from those already derived in lecture notes (Greedy proof of interval scheduling, Comparison-based sorting algorithms lower bound). What is the most disappointing is, there is only one question about graph, to draw BFS and DFS diagrams.<br /><br />I study my exam by understanding those key insight of each problem and proofs and I write the complete proof by those key insights then since I don&#039;t believe the exam will be a reciting game. However, for those who cannot regenerate the proof by key insights, congratulations, you can spend days and days reciting all the proofs and past paper. They are lenient in giving us the past papers. I would say this is good in some sense as hard work can really get you a good grade, since the professor promise for a grade lower bound, it doesn&#039;t hurt anyone that much. <br /><br />But I just don&#039;t believe that this is the correct way to examine students in a relatively hard course. Or maybe it will be a completely different story in COMP3711H but I don&#039;t have a choice this semester. I admit that in terms of hard work, I do not deserves an A+ compared to those who recite all materials.",

Just try to understand by yourself before having the lessons because you will be confused.",

When they are explaining some concepts, they are like &quot;making simple thing difficult&quot;. This takes more time to understand those concepts.<br /><br />Also, I feel like the teaching is separate from the assignments. The things they taught in class is so simple but the assignments is just another world I can say.",

Some reviews said the B-range will be very large but I don&#039;t think so, maybe due to the online mode and the professors.<br /><br />如果math真係唔好都唔緊要，只要努力就會pass到，唔洗咁擔心咁多，雖然未必會攞到好grade但至少唔洗fail!!!!同埋只要你讀過呢科 你就會有種打贏大佬嘅feel 雖然有啲人會覺得好易，我咁講好誇 但對於一啲唔鍾意math嘅CS人(我)嚟講係真係會有呢種感覺",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is so large that every assignment takes me about a week to finish. There are total 5 assignments with 1 double-sized assignment (HW3). They are usually 4-6 questions for the normal assignment and doubled for HW3. Many of the quesetions is asking you to design an algorithm with the given running time and prove the correctness and the running time. This takes me a lot of time especially DP, as they are sooooo difficult!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />You will not be able to finish those HW by just reading the lecture. So please attend the tutorials, there are some hints for the HWs and exam! <br /><br />There are also a final exam. Prof provided a lot of past papers, so you can practice and know how to answer them! Prof also said that the final exam is orientated to algorithm design problems as the assignments have a lot of working example, it is about 60-40(design - working example). I think it is fair and the questions are not that difficult (except the DP).<br /><br />我用中文講啦，如果唔係CS compulsory，我諗唔會有人reg呢科，因為真係好難好難同好難，由其是你無數學底或者你睇唔明math notation <br />如果你係CS一定要讀嘅，最好比多啲時間呢科+努力啲做題目 <br />同埋要衡量下係咪要一個sem讀曬3111 3511 3711.我建議唔好 <br />同埋好多人話呢3科都爛grade，其實3111同3511唔算爛，3711先真係爛，不過3科嘅教學都麻麻",

      "comment_workload": "The workload of this course is an absolute nightmare. Although there are no group projects or presentations, the homework itself is enough to give the experience of hell.<br /><br />There is 5 homework, with the 3rd one being double-sized, which is assumed to alleviate the workload of the course by replacing midterm with it. The homework has many questions asked for proof, which makes students found frustrating and took a long time to do.<br /><br />For me, it cost me the whole easter holiday to finish HW3 and finalized HW5 one day before the deadline (And not to mention that the deadline of HW5 was extended for 4 more days before the release of the homework. This means, if the deadline wasn&#039;t extended, I am unable to finalize it into the best version).<br /><br />During the period of HW3, some claimed that they &quot;transcended to another dimension&quot;, had mental breakdowns, and even stated HW3 is &quot;scarier than horror films&quot;. (I wasn&#039;t joking here, they really put these statements on Piazza!) You may imagine how insane these assignments can get.<br />At last, the teaching team came up with an agreement with the students to put up fewer algorithm design problems in the homework (like 50:50 ratio with problems requiring running algorithms).<br /><br />You may think that since the homework is hard, and so does the final exam. However, the final exam is much easier than the homework. One reason is that it is a closed book exam, even though it is &quot;more orientated to algorithm design questions&quot;.<br />Prof. Golin stated that since the questions on homework are too dense (i.e. takes too much time to think), they appear on homework but not exams (even for questions similar to the ones in homework).<br /><br />Side note: For Non-CSE students who somehow wish to take this course (e.g. CPEG students who want to take it as an elective), please think thrice before actually taking it, especially please evaluate the expected workload first.",

      "comment_content": "1. The content is actually simplified<br />In particular, this course has greatly simplified the discussion on depth-first search and topological sorting, and didn&#039;t talk about the notion of NP completeness. But given the CSE course pathway design, this simplification is actually reasonable.<br /><br />2. You better do self-learning before the start of the semester<br />Just because the content is simplified does not mean the content is simple! This is especially true when you are just an average student without experience in algorithm class (like me), since this course covers many algorithms in a rapid pace which, I think, an average beginner could hardly catch up. I would advise you to AT LEAST do the following before the semester starts:<br />- Get familiar with all divide-and-conquer algorithm and sorting algorithms (by get familiar, you should also understand all their properties and proofs)<br />- Grasp a basic idea on greedy algorithm and dynamic programming (e.g. the greedy choice property and the optimal substructure property)<br />- Get familiar with these graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Topological sort, MST (Prim and Kruskal), SP (Dijkstra), APSP (Floyd-Warshall) (Again, by get familiar, you should also understand all their properties and proofs)<br />Although these topics comprise almost all the content of the whole course, I guarantee that you would have a much smoother and easier course experience by doing this. (I guarantee that my guarantee is better than Kenneth&#039;s guarantee!) The contents of this course are not easily absorbable for an average student.<br /><br />3. Prove by contradiction and M.I. (and its variants) are very important to this course.<br /><br />4. Better pay attention to these topics (and their variants) when preparing for the final exam (the following is essentially a summary of the kind of questions that has appeared in the exam set by professor Golin and Ma):<br /><br />- Asymptotic notation and recurrence<br />- Properties of sorting algorithms (e.g. best-case, average-case, worst-case running time, and stability)<br />- Sorting lower bound (comparison tree model)<br />- Radix sort on integers of bounded range<br />- Indicator R.V.<br />- Divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g. subset-sum, x-discounted MCS, and designing the variants of binary search)<br />- Greedy algorithms (e.g. interval scheduling, interval partitioning, subsequence, minimum stopping)<br />- ****Dynamic Programming**** This topic is VERY IMPORTANT, since questions of this topic are usually the killer (e.g. longest monotone sequence, shuffling, minimum cost itinerary, x-discounted MCS, doubled string)<br />- BFS, DFS and Topological sort (How to apply or modify them to fit in other situations)<br />- MST (the cut lemma, prove by contradiction and counter-example)<br />- Dijkstra algorithm (its correctness proof)<br />- Variants of Floyd-Warshall algorithm (e.g. all-pair max-bottleneck problem)<br />- Application of maximum flow<br />- Dry-run of these algorithms: min-heap, AVL tree, sorting algorithms, Huffman tree, BFS, DFS, MST (Prim and Kruskal), SP (Dijkstra), Max-flow and Bipartite matching, Pattern matching automaton",

Of course, they aren&#039;t dumb questions and I don&#039;t recommend you sending him dumb questions also. And he answered each of them timely and precisely. When I say timely, it is like within 2 hours even at night time like 2200. To be honest, this is admirable.<br />Last but not least, he encourages questions. So for example, since I was so busy and literally started revising 5 days before the exam and I got some questions on pastpapers, he literally told me to have a Zoom meeting for like half an hour for clearing all concepts.<br />To be brutally frank, this is an introductory course. So the content isn&#039;t that &quot;exciting&quot;. But you can see his enormous effort in making sure that students truely understand a concept both intuitively and rigorously.",
      "comment_grading": "This is a special semester as I said. We are in a lockdown and the school doesn&#039;t open for business. Thus, we have<br />50% assignments (6 in total, with one having 200 marks, it&#039;s about dynamic programming)<br />50% final<br />I am not going to enumerate each assignment&#039;s mean. Rather, I would just go over the overall mean.<br />Assignment: mean: 80 no sd<br />Final: mean: 55 SD: 19<br />My grades:<br />Assignment: 90<br />Final: 82<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />Prof. Golin has mentioned about the threshold. For example, if you go above 90% in course overall, it is guaranteed A range. In addition, this course is using a curve. That is why I got A-.<br /><br />Grading is tough in some sense. For assignments, you really need to nail the intuition rigorously. It isn&#039;t easy.",
      "comment_workload": "Now, it really depends since to be honest, you can really copy all the references into your assignments and get it done. You can also text some of your friends that have taken this course previously. I mean, there are literally multiple ways for scoring high in assignments, which are the most important thing to establish your concepts.<br />At the end of the day, it is your motivation. I spent a lot of time in doing all assignments by myself as well as perfecting them. <br />Also, please note that I type it in Latex. So it takes extra time again.<br />Not to mention the working problems in assignments where I coded the solution. Man, you can really decide the workload.<br />Second, tutorials.<br />There are literally on average 8 weekly tutorials. Not going to lie but if you cannot grasp the concept right after the lecture, those tutorials will simply overwhelm you.<br />And they are important since assignments maybe related to them!!!<br />And so the last thing is final. <br />Well, you literally need to memorize all the stuff, for example, some proofs so as not to screw yourself when there is such a question.<br />And there are literally 16 pastpapers offered by the professor.<br /><br />so as i said, this course can be tough if you take it seriously which I believe most don&#039;t.",

Lower bounds, counting sort, radix sort<br />8. Huffman coding<br />9. Greedy algorithms<br />10. Dynamic programming (VERY HARD)<br />11. Graphs, trees<br />12.

Matching - Hungarian method (HARDEST but irrelevant)<br />18.
