I have learnt some programming before, so I am a bit unsure whether relearning if else and loops from scratch again is an enjoyable experience...<br /><br />Oh wait - out of nowhere CSE is sending an email at the start of the semester offering a C placement test to get a requisite waiver for COMP 2011. I&#039;m interested in exploring what&#039;s in COMP anyway... so.. why not? I thought.<br /><br />Anyway, this course does cover more than just learning a new programming language. C++ is called a low-level (?) programming language for a reason. Please expect that you are not only learning new syntaxes in this course.<br /><br />[Contents before midterm]<br />- C++ Basic and Control Flow (Might be a repetition of COMP1021 (?), but now you have a slightly &#039;strange&#039; syntax. They also have something called reference variable (they will usually put this quite annoying thing in the exam))<br />- Functions (Note that they are introducing passing and RETURN (some people might miss this) by reference here)<br />- Arrays (More or less like python lists)<br />- Recursion<br />- Scope (Basically which variable do you use if you have more than one definition of variable (yes, they might also test this in a very annoying way))<br />- Struct<br /><br />(Note that function overloading may be included in the first half (as seen from the given past papers, but they did not include it this year))<br /><br />[Contents after midterm]<br />- Function Overloading and Declaration (Yes, definition and declaration is different)<br /># Pointers (Basically the scariest and the main part of this course; they will also discuss how to manage memory and introduce memory leak here. You will start to understand how memory is allocated in programs after learning this part)<br />- Class (Note that they are also introducing something called constructor and deconstructor here)<br />- Stack and Queue<br /><br />- New C++ features (not included in the exam this year, includes stuff like lambda expressions and stuff that might not really be used in actual programming. But you can still read them if you got the time)",

I can see that he is trying to explain the topics and is really open for questions, but I find the explanation is a little bit confusing.

I still come to the lecture to make sure what I might have missed.<br /><br />I might suggest going to L(smaller numbers), e.g. L1, L2, L3 if possible, though. If you can&#039;t, you may try reading the slides more before class, and probably ask the instructors or post a question on piazza.<br /><br />I find that the TAs for this course are really active and ready to answer your questions. There was one time when I sent a question via email to the TA about the PA, and I received a response in less than 10 minutes. The discussion on Piazza is also really active, you will get response really fast (except for the few days before the finals, which is understandable)",

Passing the given testcases might not be enough, try to think about some crazy testcase that they might throw on your code and break it. Also, watch out that ZINC is running on linux and sometimes unitialized variables contains garbage value unlike and might produce behaviour that windows does not produce. Run your code on some linux-based compiler online and it will do the work. You might want to try github codespaces (my instructor suggested us to use this around the start of the term as some people may not have g++ installed). Try to squeeze out marks from the PA as this is a chance for you to program with a compiler.<br /><br />For the exams, practice coding on paper once in a while. You may try something like LeetCode and try their easy problems on paper. If you can do it, generally, you should be fine for the test.",

Starting with the basics, learners will gain a solid understanding of variables, data types, control structures, and functions. As the course progresses, it ventures into more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, classes, and inheritance.<br /><br />One noteworthy aspect of this course is the in-depth exploration of pointers, a concept that can be challenging even for those with prior knowledge of C++. The module on pointers thoroughly covers their usage, syntax, and the intricate details involved in memory manipulation. Students will be guided through practical examples and exercises to master this critical yet complex aspect of C++ programming.<br /><br />Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on hands-on coding exercises, ensuring that participants not only grasp theoretical concepts but also develop practical coding skills. By the end of the program, students will have a comprehensive understanding of C++ and will have successfully navigated both the foundational and more intricate chapters, including the challenging topic of pointers.",

Little did I know, it was like stepping into a coding battlefield.<br /><br />At first, it seemed innocent enough – for loops, while loops, and the intricacies of C++ syntax. I thought, &quot;Okay, this is manageable.&quot; But soon, we were thrust into the deep end, grappling with complex concepts that felt like they belonged in a coding expert&#039;s toolkit, not a major student&#039;s.<br /><br />The lack of a gradual learning curve was glaring. Going from fundamental coding to the intricacies of C++ felt like trying to sprint before learning to walk. Even as a major student, it was a challenging leap. C++, with its reputation for complexity, proved to be a formidable opponent.<br /><br />From tackling turtle graphics from python to wrestling with dynamic double linked structures and delving into object-oriented programming, the course felt like an uphill battle. A major in the subject didn&#039;t shield me from the difficulty; if anything, it intensified the struggle.<br /><br />In essence, the course structure seemed to overlook the principle of learning progression. It&#039;s like expecting someone to master a language without teaching them the alphabet first. For those contemplating this course as part of their major, brace yourselves – it&#039;s a challenging ride that might leave you questioning your coding prowess.",

I&#039;m a pretty fast learner and love learning but didn&#039;t get any form of support or grace from this course. super disappointed that they just didn&#039;t give a shit about people w minors and basically just put us there because there was nowhere else to go. do better.",

I was already taking on another 4 credit science course- LIFS3140 which was also one of the toughest courses for my major. was not a good combo and this comp course ruined both for me. never felt this way about any course before, always took accountability if I knew i just didnt try enough. thank u comp2011 for being my first ever ustspace review u deserve it.",

There are only 3 in the whole semester, but you put in ~ 3 days for the last one.

      "comment_content": "I believe the course adequately teaches a lot of basic programming skills and gives you a decent understanding of beginner level C++. For someone who has started out with python, a lot of the course contents will be very new and hard to grasp. Although the course mostly tests your coding ability and not your C++ knowledge, integrating these new concepts can be quite difficult. Some topics such as functions or recursion will be familiar, but they are already a big step up from what you will learn in first year courses. So, when topics such as pointers that don&#039;t commonly exist in most other languages come into play, most people have a really hard time wrapping their heads around them. Therefore I suggest not expecting a high grade from this course if you don&#039;t have any prior experience (besides introductory python course) OR you don&#039;t intend to invest most of your time into it. As a side note, if you are intending to take this course in the future, I highly recommend taking Java first.",
      "comment_teaching": "Although Professor Brian Mak has a nice way of teaching concepts quite well, I found his pace to be very slow. This was evident by the fact that we were many lectures behind all other sections.&nbsp;&nbsp;His speech and his tone of voice are too calm and slow which personally makes it hard to concentrate for more than 10 minutes. But besides his pacing, he is actually very interactive with the class and explains concepts nicely, although sometimes he explains the same thing too many times.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is heavily weighed towards the exams. You can expect most people to get full marks on the labs, which in my case left only the assignments and the exams. Assignments were 8% each, meaning as long as you get 90+ it shouldn&#039;t affect your grade too much. Here are my grades for reference:<br /><br />Assignments (Average): 95~/100<br />Labs: 3/3<br />Midterm: 91.5/100<br />Final: 80.25/100<br />Grade: A+",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is quite light overall but very compactly distributed. There are 3 long Programming Assignments, but you are given 2 weeks to complete each of them. It might sound like a long time, but with the debugging it can take several days to complete which can be hard when combined with other courses. The assignments themselves were (for me) hard to get full marks (but not hard to get good marks) on because they are quite expansive and it is hard to get past every hidden test case (i.e. your code isn&#039;t smart enough to fit every scenario). <br /><br />There are also labs every week which take around 5-10 minutes to complete.

While the harder one, I started 3 full days before the ddl but I couldn&#039;t finish it. My stronger friends needed 4 to 5 full days to get it done. (of course the debugging carried on to the last minute).<br />So do the assignment earlier if you are not that confident with your algorithm and coding ability.",

      "comment_content": "Sorry, but I am going to be highly biased and leave a critical review here, because a lot of reviews here make it seem like it&#039;s a pretty normal course. However, I am going to speak from the perspective of an average student who got a B in COMP1021 and had no prior experience in C++ before this course. I also have a victim mindset from this course.<br /><br />This semester they didn&#039;t go through in detail the &#039;basic&#039; lecture notes because apparently, people were complaining that it was apparently too boring. If I remember correctly, they told us to self-read these lecture notes one at a time before each next lecture and skimmed through during lecture time.<br /><br />http://2011video.cse.ust.hk/videos/list.html<br /><br />People may question why I went through these videos, but the lecture notes are almost the same and it&#039;s from about 10 years ago. 10 years ago Prof Mak took 5+ hours of quality lecture time to introduce C++ while these instructors told us to read it. I guess I am being dramatic because these beginner materials are not hard at all and they did go through it briefly. Oh well, but there&#039;s more shit to self-study later on. <br /><br />The other lecture topics, aside from those in the link<br /><br />Problems for Basics and Control<br />Function I<br />Array<br />Function II: Recursion<br />Scope<br />Function III: Miscellaneous<br />Separate Compilation<br />Struct<br /><br />Pointer<br />A YouTube video single-handedly made me understand linked list, a sub-topic of this pointer topic.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5wJkJJpKtM&amp;ab_channel=PaulProgramming<br /><br />C++ Class<br />Stack &amp; Queue<br /><br />Self Study Topics ( for one lab ) ( not tested in exam )<br />File I/O<br />String<br /><br />For each had optional tutorials.<br />For me I attended both simultaneously because of time management problems, but they weren&#039;t that helpful either. But I don&#039;t know, the information given in the lecture notes were not that helpful for the lab either.",
      "comment_teaching": "To be honest, Professor Li is may be passionate. If you think about some instructors, they are indeed capable enough to transmit this curiosity and passion to students. My opinion: Professor Li unfortunately did not have this effect on me.<br /><br />An immense number of times in lectures, she would go on and on about some part. Her monologues were detailed, but not concise. One thing that would tremendously improve her lecture is live speech-to-text conversion because my attention span could not remember the run-on sentences that she articulated with. She does have a plethora of knowledge to share.<br /><br />A fact: at the last class, there were less than 10 students in the face-to-face lectures. Around 15 students on zoom. And I still wonder to this day how the were the other 65 students were doing.<br /><br />I honestly did not know how to attend her lectures for the first half of the semester. After continuous effort going to lectures with a notebook and pen, seeking to draw some clear points being productive and shit... nearing the end of sem, I just sat and listened to her talk. It was actually much better because I got to at least focus on her words more clearly.<br /><br />It seems like they are recording the lecture but they are not published. Then what&#039;s the point of recording it?? <br />Please, I beg you, please, can you please, could you just make it easier for students to access these&nbsp;&nbsp;information not just for students who are not in HK if you recorded it please?<br /><br />An D to the teaching at the end because of the culture that they spread, which is honestly not even about plagiarism but about collaboration. They are so strict with plagiarism that they don&#039;t allow you to get explicit help from anyone in this course, which sucks, because I was stuck at certain tasks for days. Collaboration is pretty much discouraged. I mean, truth be told, it didn&#039;t really affect me because I had no friends but at the same time, I felt very reluctant to ask for help as I thought the help I would get would not be specific enough or whatever. I felt isolated. My opinion.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading? I don&#039;t have anything to say. It&#039;s fair, for the ability you show, not necessarily the time you spend. That is sort of true with every course and that&#039;s no revelation.<br /><br />I legit couldn&#039;t care any less about the so called competition in this course because the only competition there is, is for those smart people who wanna get A-range. I just wanted to get a B or a C.<br /><br />Most of the contents of the exam seems to focus on the big, later lectures including pointers, stack/queue, class, struct. Recursion and array are&nbsp;&nbsp;important too. The broadness of topics is actually not bad.<br /><br />Realistic stats<br /><br />Quiz 25/35 Mean: 27 or 28<br />Finals 26/100, mean: 49/100 or something.<br /><br />Assignments<br />PA1 88/100, mean 88/100<br />PA2 59/100, mean 71/100<br />PA3 88/100, mean 84/100<br /><br />Every semester, they make 1 or 2 of the PA more difficult/easier or whatever. PA2 is harder this year.<br /><br />Lab<br />10/10<br /><br />Grade I got: C<br /><br />It&#039;s not bad actually, I thought I would be given an F after that finals. I don&#039;t even know how you would study for finals. For me, I spent 60% of time revising the lecture notes and going through the examples inside and 40% doing 2 past papers so don&#039;t do that.",
      "comment_workload": "I remember in this semester spending like 2 good days trying to do that self-study lab and still not being able to complete it. The main problem with me is that I did not try hard to seek for help so<br /><br />TIP: Use the piazza when you need it. Go to office hours if you are truly stuck. The first time I got into office hours, the TA was not strict about straight out giving me solution for first task of a lab.<br /><br />I remember in this semester spending 5 days to do PA2, that seemingly other people writing these reviews can do within 3 days. Yet I could not finish that assignment and I got 59/100. Fact: I went to counselling because of the hopelessness I suffered while doing the PA2. Fact: When I looked at the answer to PA2. I had two thoughts:<br /><br />1. What is this?<br />2. I am satisfied because I would never be able to think of such a complicated solution.<br /><br />TIP: TO be fair, considering you start really early when the PA is given out, like 2-3 days after it&#039;s published, maybe you could finish the PA without so much pressure.",

That&#039;s why the course was pretty easy for me.<br />You can check the content from others feedback which is very common teaching scope of any fundamental programming course in any universities. <br /><br />I kinda fucked up my online MC quiz because I thought we could only compile the code with human brain (not with paper) and go back to previous questions (the canvas system didn&#039;t allow students to go back to previous submitted questions). So, I just finished the test within 30 mins out of 45 and waited there for freaking 15 mins rethinking my mistakes. Fuck man.

Those Indians, Russians and Chinese online videos on YouTube will be extremely useful in your later career if you want to do self-learning or watch extra content of your courses.

I studied this course and Computer Organization in the same semester yet, this is not a good decision at all. The homework deadline of these 2 courses overlapped all the time with other deadline of stupid LANG courses. So, COMP2011 is a good course to take if your deadlines don&#039;t collide together.

I am also glad that I get a responsible and patient TA on my lab session. The overall experience as a student of COMP2011 is perfect.",
      "comment_grading": "Please refer to other posts for details. I think the grading of this semester is pretty nice compared to past ones&#039;. Getting almost fullmark on PA and Lab is a necessary but not sufficient condition for most students aiming for A+, unless you do a really good job on final. For the rest of students, don&#039;t get too nervous on final. As long as you do the lab and PA BY YOURSELF, I think at least A range is secured. In this semester&#039;s final, about half of students are below 40/100. Comparing it to the statistics of PAs, I have sufficient reasons to believe that a large portion of them did not finish the labs and PAs independently. As the exercises provided by the teaching team are far less than enough, please make use of every chance you get, not just wasting them by &quot;Legal Communication To Other Students&quot;. According to my friends&#039; and my scores, the overall cutoff between A+ and A should be around 87.",
      "comment_workload": "As I already said in CONTENT part, the workload of this course is pretty light as the lab and PA are really easy, i mean really. The time I spent on checking my PA submissions is twice more than the time spent on writing them (though it is actually not necessary). There is a special point worth being mentioned: write all your codes on txt file and force yourself finish them onethrough because in the exam, you have no opportunity to check your codes by compiling them and no hints about syntax will be given. If you cannot overcome the anxiety during the exam due to the above reasons, you may be crushed and get a suck score. In f2f mode, the coding part is very likely to be hand-written, which also take you some time to get familiar with.",

      "comment_workload": "I guess it&#039;s reasonable for a 4 credit course. If it was a 3 cred course, I would give an E.<br /><br />Nearly every week, you need to hand in a lab homework which cost you a few hours per week. And throughout the semester, you got to do 3 Programming assignments (PAs), each of which gives you about 2 weeks to work on. And then of course you have a quiz/mid-term, and a final exam. Because of COVID, the tests were all done on Canvas. <br /><br />I would argue this course should be called as &quot;Introduction to OOP and Algorithm&quot; instead, because you always need to think of different algorithms to make your program work in labs and PAs. As someone who has nearly 0 programming background (I only took VBA 1022q before), thinking algorithms on a whim is challenging to me. It would be ideal if you can find someone to work and brainstorm together, because that&#039;s what I did to secure my PA scores.<br /><br />Again, as someone who has very little programing background (I am a SBM student), the concept of recursion overwhelmed me a bit when I first learned about it, but later picked it up with the help of friendship. Surprisingly, I don&#039;t find pointer really hard, it is just confusing sometimes when you assign a lot of pointers, such as a binary tree structure, so make sure you have a crystal clear flow of thinking.<br /><br />For the final, make sure you do past papers, review your past Labs and PAs, and remember how each algorithm in those questions work, because they can be very useful. However, as the exam was done on Canvas, you cannot use tab on the text editor, and for this semester, we were required to leave comments on our code, which could be very time-consuming, and causing many of us cannot finish the exam.",

Do start early so you will have time for revision. We had a lot of recursion problems this semester and &quot;thinking recursively&quot; is the key to tackle the problem. <br /><br />3. Final: Though I got a shitty grade but I really did try HARD for exam prep...remember to finish all the past papers and be familiar with all the ppt contents! Just try to fully understand how all the concepts work and remember it, I mean by being able to type the whole structure down from scratch. You may cry yourself to sleep after the final since it&#039;s way too damn hard but you&#039;ll be fine if you tried hard enough, trust me. <br /><br />4. General advice: First, practice typing all the coding examples on the ppts by yourself, merely understanding is far from enough. Second, when you feel like dying and really cannot compose shit then just go to Piazza to ask for help or ask that kind friend of yours to give you some feedback/support. Just never give up and believe you can surely do this, you can definitely defeat COMP2011. Good luck!!",

That mean you need to repeat it for many many many time to answer a single long question.<br /><br />It seems that it is not my personal problem as the mean is really low even though the question is not that difficult.<br /><br />For the Exam, the mean is 39.8.<br />For the Assignments, the mean is always around 8x% while there are always &gt;200 students in my lecture group get full marks.<br /><br />So, I truely hope that you don&#039;t need to take the exam on Canvas.",

He obviously knows what he&#039;s teaching very well and will give you the lower level explanation of most C++ functionality if you ask for it. <br /><br />The lectures are paced quite poorly in my opinion though. I dont know whether to blame him or whoever made this course syllabus but it spends way to long on basic stuff and too little time on complex topics.<br /><br />I recommend you self-study most of this course because of this awkward pacing. However, if you have never seen C/C++ code then attending a few lectures might be worthwhile.",

That is, to pass, you are required to have<br />(total score &gt;= X) AND (quiz score * 0.08 + final exam score * 0.46 &gt;= Y).<br />X and Y will be determined at the end of the semester but we may promise you that:<br />X will not be greater than 50, and<br />Y will not be greater than 16.<br />(It is assumed that all scores in the above formula are scaled to 100 maximum.)<br /><br />lab exercises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%<br />programming assignments: 36% (10%, 12%, 14%)<br />quiz:\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8%<br />final exam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46%<br /><br />Means:<br />Labs: around 2.8/3<br />PAs: 88.2%, 78.8%, 84.9% (acc. to Canvas)<br />these means were way higher than previous sems but the assignments were quite easy so I understand why.<br />Quiz: 79.2%<br />Final: 40%<br /><br />Me:<br />Labs, PAs: 100%<br />Quiz: 79%<br />Final: 63.5%<br />Edit: This got me an A.<br />Little rant: the final was one of the most poorly designed assessment of a student&#039;s skills I have ever seen. Maybe I am just a butthurt baby but seriously, this typing code on Canvas (without being able to use Tabs or a separate text editor) is so time consuming. Plus, you have to remember all variable/class/function names otherwise you spend half your time scrolling back and forth from the code in the question and your code box. Many of the questions basically required you to write an algorithm to perform certain actions like shifting all the elements in a 2D array (without any indexing, only pointers) but you have to dry run everything in your head. Like when and where do you ever have to dry run such a complex algorithm in the real world?!??! A programming course shouldn&#039;t even have a final exam, but rather, have really hard projects instead.",
      "comment_workload": "Again, I basically knew C++ coming into this course so the weekly labs and the programming assignments were quite easy. The labs maybe took 2 hours at most, usually an hour though. The assignments took a lot longer though. People complained about memory leaks or whatever but they really aren&#039;t that big of an issue in my opinion. Use Zinc to test all your submissions and you&#039;ll probably get full too.

Therefore, please do read every slide of your lecture notes. They are pretty short actually. Do recall everything covered in the quiz as they will ask you tricky questions (like those in COMP1022P).

I think they do all these INTENTIONALLY to limit our time. Three tips for people taking this kind of exam later:<br />1. Write your code in recursive ways (usually iterative way cost more time)<br />2. Be sure that you can write all function taught in class without much thinking...they examine some functions like deleting linked list which already stated in the lecture notes :)<br />3.

I know some students takes weeks to finish it. For me it takes around 20-25 hours in total.<br />The other 2 PA are easier, finish within 1 day.<br /><br />Workload really depends on your own experience and expectations.<br /><br />If you take 1021/1022q as the prerequisite, then please pay more attention because C++ is completely different from python and VBA. Especially 1021 teaches turtle??? which is useless in this course...<br />I think the most difficult things for 1021 students will be the syntax and concepts of OOP. (As python is too easy to use!)<br /><br />If you take 1022p as the prerequisite, congrats! Those content taught in 1022p are useful in 2011(because it is also OOP).

However there is no plagiarism checking for labs so you can simply copy the code from your friends or even from online, yet doing it by yourself is still highly recommended.<br /><br />The programming assignments(PA) is the main workload during the semester, they are significantly more complex than the labs, so you probably need more time to finish them. In general, I highly recommend to start working on it once it is released because I don&#039;t think you can use one day to finish the whole PA, especially for the later ones. The first two PAs are not that hard so most people get full marks in them. However, PA3 is really disastrous and mind-blowing, you probably need to spend a lot of time to understand the requirement even you start to code anything for it. PA4 is less difficult than PA3, but it is still hard. Generally speaking , the workload of the PAs is quite high, especially for the last two PAs, you probably need to spend a lot of time in grinding it if you really want to get full mark in all PAs.<br /><br />P.S. Don&#039;t try to copy directly from others for PA, it definitely doesn&#039;t work in the way you want.",

Although some of them were not included in the exam, still they are all very useful. For me, things go crazy when using pointer because it is a rather complicated thing and when deleting all pointers using a loop, you have to be very careful.",

Some students did their labs during the lab session but I prefer doing it before the lesson, so I could immediately show my programme to the TAs and go. But don&#039;t worry the labs are easy. The first two assignments were easy and I didn&#039;t use much time. The last two were so difficult for me and I even couldn&#039;t finish it. To be honest, I shall put more time on practising programming. The difficulty of the midterm was at the right level. Btw, some past papers will be provided on the course website.",

The topics before mid-term exam are considerably basic while those afterwards are much more vague and complicated, especially with recursion and&nbsp;&nbsp;pointers which are very logical.<br />Lab assignments are compulsory and follows closely the contents taught in lecture.

      "comment_content": "The course teaches about the fundamentals of C++. Here is a snapshot of the syllabus:<br /><br />Basics (main, namespace, data types, constants)<br />- Control (For loops, switch statements, enum)<br />- Functions (declare and call functions, pass by value &amp; by reference, return by value &amp; return by reference)<br />Struct<br />- Cpp11 new features (general initialization using {} list, range for statement, lambda expressions)<br />- Scope (File, function, block scope)<br />- Pointers<br />- Arrays<br />- Recursion <br />- Class<br /><br />All of the content is very practical and up-to-date to modern C++. It helped me understand the entire syntax and how C++ works in general. <br /><br />Everything starting from the basics until functions should be pretty fundamental and easy to understand if you have taken a previous CS introductory course. <br /><br />Topics from Struct to Scope should be straightforward as well, just pay attention to the specific syntax and how the features are used and you should be fine. <br /><br />Starting from pointers, things are getting slightly more difficult as you are expected to know how they relate to normal variables and arrays and memory manipulation. For the last few lectures, you need to know how all the concepts come together as you will be expected to implement them in the exams.<br /><br />Overall the content is great and very appropriate.",
      "comment_teaching": "The professor is pretty articulate in explaining concepts that might be pretty difficult to understand at first. He makes things easier to comprehend and demonstrates a lot of code examples in class which will clarify a lot of things. He is also very open to any kind of questions in class, so definitely take the chance in class to ask questions you are not sure of.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading is a bit harsh I would say. To my knowledge (not sure whether it is 100% accurate though), midterm mean is around 55 and final mean around 63, and you need at least 25 points above the mean to get an A. Getting the mean should be a B- or C+.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is quite manageable. Every week, there will be a lab which you will have to complete a program that is already partly written for you. The labs are quite easy to complete but some, especially the later ones, might take some time.<br /><br />Throughout the semester, you will also get project assignments to&nbsp;&nbsp;do, around once per month. The assignments really demand some effort and time, so be prepared to spend more than a week on it, a few days if you have more familiarity with C++.",

To be a good programmer, you may devote certain amount of time to learn some tricks behind the C++ features to write good program, and that&#039;s the workload I refer to.<br />Of course, if you enjoy learning programming, you won&#039;t find it tired and time-consuming.<br />But as a deadline fighter, i did a large amount of drilling in recursion and class 5 days before final, and i finally realize how my assignment 3 should be implemented.

I personally skipped most of the lab sections and submitted the exercises on Canvas.<br />Quizzes are not heavy loads for me as I gave up all of them and all in final instead.<br />The final exam is quite challenging so it takes much time to prepare for. As I had the MATH 2033 exam one day before, there was not too much time to prepare the exam for the COMP 2011 and I suffered from it.<br />In all, the workload of the course is quite heavy, especially for labs involving higher-level knowledge such as pointers and linked lists.",

In our batch the mean was 54 which is quite low. The paper was quite tough.<br /><br />The first Assignment is 5% and is quite easy. The second asssignment is 9% which is hard and the final assignment is worth 10% which is the hardest of them all.",

The first assignment is quite easy and you will think all of them will be easy but thats not the case. The assignments get way harder later. The worst thing about the assignment is that you will have to do labs simultaneously with the assignments. If you have two weeks to do an assignment that means in those two weeks you will have to do two labs as well. As i mentioned earlier the labs get quite harder later so it consumes time as well.

Some of them took me a heck of a long time to debug or to understand the algorithm. But they are rewarding if you do them seriously. Anyway, if you are already proficient in programming fundamentals, you probably have the skills to clear all the tasks in seconds.<br /><br />As for the assignments, I took more time on reading the instructions than writing the actual code lol. You gotta be careful in order to fulfill all the requirements man.<br /><br />If you do the labs with heart, read through the lecture notes, and practice with past papers, I guarantee that you will do great!

There will be many students who have already studied C++ in high school before, and they would definitely raise the mean. Apart from that, the content gets hard and requires a lot of effort and time commitment.",

Once you are done with those courses, you have a certain level of liking for programming, and a certain expectation regarding the way programming works, and regarding the amount of effort you require in it. But boom, as soon as you take this course, you realize what real programming is, and how much effort it is. There is a lot of effort, and avoid taking this course if you have a lot of credits for the semester. The syllabus till before the midterm is basically just recursion and loops. However, after midterm, we are introduced to arrays, pointers, classes and objects, stacks and queues, linked lists etc.",

It is taught using Eclipse, which is an okay IDE, and other than pointers, all the concepts taught are also fairly easy to grasp. However, people who have not not done C++ before have to put in effort, because otherwise the concepts will not be clear. The exams of this course are really testing and cannot be aced unless your concepts are strong.",
