      "comment_content": "The course name is everything it contains. Data Visualization. From basic concept to practical method to real project, its content is quite comprehensive and consequently massive. That&#039;s also a challenge for students to remember so much knowledge if not interested. After all, its final tests everything from the course.",
      "comment_teaching": "The professor is really good. Despite his Chinglish, he gives high-quality lectures. In fact, his weird pronunciation is something attracts me to focus on class, too. He reads PPTs but reads them in a quite humorous way. Although I didn&#039;t attend the lectures very often (I am too lazy to get to the classroom...), I do enjoy his style of giving the lecture",
      "comment_grading": "Project: 50%<br />Final 30%;<br />Written Assignment 10%<br />Attendance 10%<br /><br />Project: carried by groupmates. Pretty good response from prof.<br />Final mean + sd<br />WA don&#039;t know. Didn&#039;t get a response<br />Attendance maybe 80%?<br /><br />Final grade: A+",
      "comment_workload": "If you don&#039;t put much effort into the group project, literally you won&#039;t have any workload.<br />That&#039;s what I have gone through. For the final, I just spent a whole day writing notes and reciting. For WA, I freestyle...<br />Oh btw, there are three pre3 through the semester. That may require some workload.",
