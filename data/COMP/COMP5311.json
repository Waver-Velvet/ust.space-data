      "comment_content": "Basically follows the classic DB textbook &quot;Database System Concepts&quot;. The contents covered were quite UG-level (SQL, relational model, query optimization, join algorithms, transactions, and concurrent control...)<br /><br />2/3 of the semester were course lectures and 1/3 were student presentations. Only contents in lectures were examed. No attendance requirement.",
      "comment_teaching": "Dimitris is good at explaining things in a clear way.<br />Apart from his teaching, he is quite nice. He tries his best to accommodate all your (reasonable) requests on presentation and survey submission arrangements.",
      "comment_grading": "Have no idea with the final grading scheme, but I think it is fair. My final exam score ranked around top 25%, and I got A-.<br /><br />The exam questions were standard, which covered all aspects I mentioned and focused on basic concepts and approaches.",
      "comment_workload": "No assignment or project. One survey (around 3000 words required) and one presentation (less than 15min) in a DB-related research area. One final exam.<br /><br />P.S. Dimitris&#039;s advice on the survey and presentation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Independently of your topic, focus on the general problem and methodologies. Try to avoid technical details and complicated math&quot;",
