It motivates hard-working students without sacrificing the less hard-working students<br />Examples:<br />If a student got 95 out of 100 for the basic tasks, but he got 6 bonus points, the final score will be: MIN(95+6, 100) = 100<br />If a student got 100 out of 100 and got 0 bonus points, the final score will be: MIN(100+0, 100) = 100",

First one was building a course registration system and second one was related to event-driven programming. both were simple.<br />Note that the comment given in the skeleton code can be confusing.

She is also a ChatGPT enthusiast (ChatGPT was used to fill in the gaps when she can&#039;t figure out what to explain) and wasn&#039;t very confident.<br /><br />She improved quite a bit during the semester as she got adjusted to teaching. She was able to prepare her own examples for the trickier points of Java&#039;s behaviour, and preparing her own materials enabled her to structure her teaching a bit better. At the end, she was at least an above average prof when she figured out she&#039;s doing.<br /><br />The labs prepared by the teaching team were generally pretty good, and provided hands-on experience to add on the topics presented in the lecture.<br /><br />B for showing improvement throughout the semester and at least trying to do her job properly (which some people *cough cough 3111* were unable to do).",
      "comment_grading": "When combined with the low difficulty of the assignments and labs in general, the grading scheme is heavily skewed towards the (explosively difficult) final exam.<br /><br />8% Attendance (15 iPRS responses out of a total of ~25 are enough for the full score, graded on response and not on correctness)<br />42% Programming Assignments (21% each, 2 assignments)<br />8% labs (11 Labs)<br />42% Final Exam<br /><br />Assignments<br />=================<br />Assignments are actually smaller than normal COMP 2012(H) PAs despite carrying a large percentage of the grade. The first assignment was on general OO design and Java collections. The second was on&nbsp;&nbsp;event-driven programming and multithreading. None of them were too tricky nor difficult - the most annoying thing might&#039;ve been PA1&#039;s logic.<br /><br />Despite mentioning a &quot;bonus scheme&quot;, none of thee PAs had any bonus whatsoever. Maybe an oversight?<br /><br />Final Exam<br />=================<br />The final exam was where the &quot;hell&quot; in the title came from. It was a 2 hour pure MC test, and every single question ranged from &quot;moderately difficult&quot; to &quot;ungodly hard&quot;. The MCQs nearly all had multiple answers, and the marking scheme strongly discouraged guessing - any wrong answer in a multi-answer question instantly made you lose all marks for the entire question, and your answers are graded on floor(correct * question_score / total_correct). The entire thing combined led to the lowest mean (30.7/100) I&#039;ve ever seen in an HKUST exam, and possibly the hardest final paper I&#039;ve had the (dis)pleasure of sitting through.<br /><br />This is not to say that the final was set badly though. Each question definitely examined how clear your concepts are - get them slightly wrong and you&#039;re screwed. It is a great way to make sure you&#039;ve got most of Java&#039;s trickier behaviours down.<br /><br />The final exam is the real grade differentiator. Since everyone gets full marks in the PAs/labs/attendance, this means that each mark in the final matters much much more than anything else. The &quot;one-exam-kills-all&quot; approach is why the grading is a C here.<br /><br />Getting full for labs and attendance, 99/81 for the PAs (oops), and 54/100 for the final results in an A.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload for this course is actually really low.<br /><br />The labs are not difficult (mostly) and can be finished in under an hour if you&#039;re unfamiliar with the topic. <br /><br />The assignments are very easy unlike COMP 2011/2012/2012H assignments. There are not a lot of hidden test cases to screw you over, and you can leverage the entire Java standard library to make your code more concise. It should take you no longer than 5 hours to finish one if you have listened to the lectures.",

The competition is extremely high in this course, so you have no right to make mistakes.

You know, asians can do well without understanding much because they have tests in their DNA.

Rather than being tedious, they are generally shorter than the 2011/2012 ones, but require good understanding of the concepts and lots of googling in order to know how to implement some parts.<br /><br />Labs generally take &lt;1 hour to finish. 1 or 2 of them may be harder, but you can always ask the TA or even the prof for tips.<br /><br />Final exam is open-book where you can bring anything (in paper) into the exam venue, so you don&#039;t have to spend time memorising the stuffs. The exam questions are quite tricky, so you should spend some time trying different special cases before the exam.",

Prof directly copied and pasted Desmond and Alex&#039;s PowerPoint, leading to an awkward situation where he cannot understand and explain many questions in the PowerPoint. Most of the time, I am self-learning via youtube and Bilibili.<br />There are four programming assignments. All of the four assignments are extremely near 100 points since they are just too easy and with too many bugs. I don&#039;t really understand why a COMP 3xxx course&#039;s programming assignment only tests a student&#039;s ability of how to use String Class&#039;s default method. Except for PA1, all the remaining PAs are just copies of the demonstration code from the textbook. Even the labs are more difficult than PAs but the labs are derived from the past years&#039; lectures. TAs are too lazy to prepare anything solid.",
      "comment_teaching": "Don&#039;t read the PowerPoint and say &quot;syntax sugar! more fun!&quot; please. It should be better for the professor to do the research rather than teach students. To be honest, these four TAs are maybe the TAs with the most dazzling resume. But it doesn&#039;t influence that they know nothing about Java and know how to communicate with each other in teaching students. The happiest time of their cooperation should be finding a way to pull down the scores of some unlucky students, so as to complete the course better. What&#039;s more, improve your spoken English please!",
      "comment_grading": "The most interesting part. My mom always taught me to tolerate others&#039; fault, but after seeing these four TAs I suddenly understand not every man in the world has a mother.<br />If you are a born cheater, I should say that this is definitely the best course prepared in CSE for you. We have two mids and one final, and all of them have a make-up because of TAs&#039; stupid mistakes. All three exams have many sessions, and if you can get the test paper from your friends, Congratulations! Because all the papers are remarkably the same. And you can do the test 1 hour earlier than others. The final is a 15 minutes&#039; 20 T/F questions, but hey how can TAs make stupid mistakes in this simple test? 1. Well first, they got the wrong answer for the grading. 2. Then they suddenly found that two TAs mistakes up the exam period! and one-half of the students got&nbsp;&nbsp;20 mins to finish the exam, too good! 3. Students took the test behind can directly got the paper from the previous session! 4. one-half of the students got&nbsp;&nbsp;20 mins to finish the exam, unfair! How to fix that? We can give all the students to take make-up in 15minutes with much similar questions. Anyone with basic logic and common sense knows that the best remedy is for everyone to take the test again or give everyone a 20-minute make-up. But they don&#039;t want to. I don&#039;t know how they got into graduate school and Ph.D., Canvas shows that the students who take make-up are 3 points higher than the previous test on average, some of them even get high.<br />The overall mean on Canvas is 95.4, but the real one is much higher. 99 A range, 97 B range, 95 C range. Nice and fair grading indeed. I am ready to get C range now. Thank you TAs!<br />Update(WOW! PA4&#039;s grade is not decided by the result of the test case, but the result of the interview. I got 40 points deducted! Good!)",
      "comment_workload": "After the final, we suddenly received an announcement that we need another code interview, due tomorrow. I mean what the fxxk? most of the students still have many exams to finish. They change the grading scheme implicitly only because TAs found that most students&#039; overall grades are beyond 95, and they need a reason to drag down your students&#039; grades. Then a clever and lovely professor came up with a solution: 60/109 students were picked up and interviewed after the exam period, and I got deducted points hahaha. TAs: even if you pass the final test and got 100, your implementation is not correct, you forgot to test this feature. But why you say if you can pass the given test.java your PA4 grade would have no problems when we submitted the PA4? Different TAs will ask you different questions, and your final grade will deduct. For the rest of the 49 students, I should say that God really blesses these lucky dogs.",

I make a disclaimer here.<br /><br />If you see 4 Es in this comment session, those are ONLY applicable for 2022 Spring, or any session where the name &quot;ZHANG, Charles Chuan&quot; appears on the name of the instructor in the future (I hope it will never happen though...).

Originally, this is a good course but it is completely ruined by this professor, as well as the ratings here.<br /><br />Anyway, I still encourage you to read this comment to see how shxt this professor is and try to avoid him in the future.<br /><br />Ah, btw, I get a B- eventually. I dont know what happened but I sincerely appreciate for Charles&#039;s last pity for not killing me straightly. However, I will still regard this learning experience as TRASH.

WITH BUNCH OF METHODSSSSSS TO BE IMPLEMENTED??????<br /><br />Teaches the least, contains the most content in labs...<br /><br />Ok so if you think this has been the worst part of the course, don&#039;t worry, please read the other three titles.",
      "comment_teaching": "Since this part is ultimately long so I put the central idea first : When you see this prof teaching this course, PLEASE DON&#039;T REG. THIS GUY IS DEKAI 2.0. Wait for SC Cheung or Alex. Or if you don&#039;t mind your elective requirement then just find another elective. FreeCodeCamp is your good friend for learning Java. Anyway, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR!!!<br /><br />Great, talk about the teaching, I am indeed speechless but I still try to describe it out with words so that other people can know what is happening.<br /><br />First, talk about the professor, he is a quite chill guy. He plays music before lecture starts. However, he speaks very very slow. Even I play the lecture recording in 1.25x I still find no difference from a normal person talking. Also, he hesitates a lot. These make me hard to concentrate. Moreover, it seems like he doesn&#039;t know Java very clearly. Quite often when students asked questions, he didn&#039;t know how to answer. I think he is not a really professional Java programmer.<br /><br />However, the lecture is not the worst thing. The worst thing is his course management strategies. <br /><br />The most annoying thing is, his plan keeps changing. At the first lecture, he proposed for 3 PAs and a regular final exam. But at a particular instance of the semester, he changes his mind by adding one more PA (which due during final exam period), shrinking (not cancel) the scale of final (in terms of both amount and grade proportion) and adding unknown amount of assessment tasks. THANK YOU PROF <br /><br />Ok so these are still not quite a big deal compared to the below things. Here comes the real annoyance <br /><br />When everyone feels happy and relieved about the semester finally ends...<br /><br />Professor : SUrPRisE MoThERFuCkER<br /><br />Guess what. He add an assessment task (2nd coding interview) AFTER THE FINAL EXAM, without any prior notification. It just comes randomly, arbitrarily, out of thin air. WHAT THE FUCK? <br /><br />Originally, the coding interview was announced on 26 May and due on 27 May (I am not lying, one day due). This triggered a lot of students because 27 and 28 May still has final exam (For me I have COMP2211 and COMP3111 final in these two days) and the due date is short. Therefore, he changes his mind AGAIN. Instead of asking every students to submit a respond document, he randomly picked 60 students (in 109 students) to have a Zoom interview on 30 May, which is today.<br /><br />I just can&#039;t get it why he insists to hold a interview RANDOMLY and AFTER FINAL. Do you know how I feel about that? <br /><br />I think many of you have played New Super Mario Bros Wii right? When I played it for the first time, I feel relieved that Bowser is finally defeated in the last castle stage. However, a witch comes out and after some magic, Bowser recovers and become giant. When I see that I think : OMG I still need to beat Bowser again? That&#039;s my feeling<br /><br />For some translation : When I feel relieved that final period ends, this course ends, the whole semester ends, this motherfuxker gives out a pop-up assessment, which frustrates me deeply. I just want some rest.<br /><br />Also, I can&#039;t get it why he randomly picked 60 people only, which will make the situation more unfair.<br /><br />Another thing really triggered me is that, even though the course is in complete chaos and professor is clearly torturing us, he still thinks that he is a nice person, these things help us and he does a good job. He claimed that these policies are helping us to &quot;overcome the hard covid period&quot; and &quot;give us more practical practice for Java&quot; . I just got annoyed by these nonsense.<br /><br />Then, the TAs, which are the assistants of professor torturing us. They are not only useless in the lab (Only repeat the ppt), but also nearly made mistakes in any part of their work, which worsen the situation. They are like coming to troll and sabotage us. Here are some examples :<br />1. Labs contained many bugs<br />2. PA contains BUGS and WRONG TEST CASES<br />3. In the midterm coding demo, they gives out WRONG TEST CASES as well, which seriously affect the judgement of students under such a pressure test<br />4. In the final, two of the TAs mistaken the exam time from 15 mins to 20 mins<br /><br />I think these mistakes are very ridiculous, unreasonable and unprofessional. I have never meet a programming course which contains these huge amount of mistakes (We all should appreciate the professional COMP2011 and COMP2012 teaching team). <br /><br />So everything went wrong, and how did the professor deal with it? Make-up. Make-up. Make-up. Anything went wrong just make-up. All midterm and final has make-up (Not maximum policy, so if you screwed up in make-up. Congratulations, you waste time and effort in decreasing your score). I just feel tired when we have 4 midterms and 2 finals in one course. When I am dealing with this course, I hope my life can also have a make-up then I will straightly jump mushroom right now. Unfortunately this is not true. <br /><br />Although prof try to compensate us by offering make-up, I just got annoyed by them. Instead of make-up everything, he should ensure things do not go wrong (Just look at 2011 or 2012, will these programming course be this chaotic?). This is the duty and responsibility of being the course coordinator. It is infuriating that the teaching team made a lot of mistakes but students need to take the accountability and join the make-up. Why? What did we do wrong? We did nothing. All mistakes come from your fucking stupid teaching team. And now we need to waste more time and effort to prepare for those make-upssssss in order to compensate your fault?????? Moreover, the repeated mistakes also implies that professor and TA never learn from history, which is very disappointing.<br /><br />Also, although the professor tries to make the course more fruitful and more practical, unfortunately, they need to be executed CORRECTLY. Otherwise, it will backfire. This professor genuinely does not know how to manage a course but he keep proposing more ideas to make the situation even worse. Currently, everything went wrong and every student in this course is suffering. This course is off the track in any possible direction and it is full of unfairness. It is a catastrophic failure. If you cannot ensure things can be executed correctly, then please don&#039;t propose them out. Just adopt the usual course structure. Your proposed changes just created a more unfair situation and tortured students more. WHAT IS THE POINT?<br /><br />The only good thing from this course is that the professor opened a complain board (forum), where students can complain anonymously. GOOD, because now everyone can see how we suffered from this piece of shit. Everyone can see how desperate, helpless, frustrated and angry we are. <br /><br />Very probably the fucking prof and TAs deal with none of the complaints; but have been reading it with a big smile on their face, just like those celebrities watching player falling from the glass bridge one-by-one in Squid Game.<br /><br />If you are interested, please access the website below (I swear it is not virus or rickroll. If it is then i get five Ds in this semester)<br /><br />Website of complain board : https://xoyondo.com/mb/2WXq6OJsZWP5cZk<br /><br />I use 3 songs to summarize this course. Prof I recommend you to play them in your lecture because they fits you:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-KwYX2u8e4<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkTb9GP9lVI<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B0CyOAO8y0 <br />(ps : 1.25x speed is recommended for the third one)<br /><br />(I can&#039;t believe I used half hour to criticize a course...But I am very angry about this course so I just did it. If here has option of F I will definitely give all Fs)<br /><br />(Update 31/5/2022)<br />Now the prof made a new BIG TROLL. For our PA4, he proposed a new marking scheme today suddenly. Aside from the correctness of the code (output checking), now the semantics are also take into account. Specifically, &quot;Whether your code is robust and close to the best practice for the programming task&quot; (From prof. email). That is, if your output is correct but you write spaghetti code then you will still got point deduction.<br /><br />(The above coding review part is applicable for non-interview students only. For interview student, they will consider interview performance instead.)<br /><br />In 109 of students, 78 students got marks deduction, either -12 marks or -24 marks out of 100 marks<br /> <br />I GOT DEDUCTED BY 24 MARKS. WOW<br /><br />I mean...it is good to ask student not to write spaghetti code and practice for a good programming habit. However,<br /><br />YOU NEVER MENTION IT BEFORE<br /><br />How can your marking scheme change suddenly after we submitted the assignment? Does that even sound fair??? University always emphasize honesty and warns student not to cheat, but now this professor shows ZERO HONESTY and cheated on us. <br /><br />I start suspecting the whole teaching team did these things deliberately due to some reasons (Revenge?). I can&#039;t imagine the whole teaching team is stupid as fuck and did EVERYTHING wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the teaching team start trolling and sabotage us after the SFQ is due so that we cannot change the ratings. GOOD. I will blacklist this prof forever.<br /><br />Anyway, I am done with this course. As long as you don&#039;t give me F then I am contented.<br /><br />(Update 31/5/2022 13:27)<br />Fine, since too many students complained, the professor finally gives up this new policy",
      "comment_grading": "1. Labs 10%<br />2. Lecture exercise 10%<br />3. Programming assignments (10%+15%+15%+15%)<br />4. Mid-term coding show (5%+10%)<br />5. Final exam (10%)<br />6. Coding interview (??%+??%)<br />7. Bonus of finding error (+2% max)<br /><br />The only thing I would say is : GARBAGE<br /><br />The proportion of daily assessment and exam assessment is 75:25. For a programming course, it is a nightmare. Because everyone will just get full marks in daily assessment, which means everyone has got 75% by default (If not then you have already died). Moreover, the mid-term coding shows are also easy. Many people just get &gt;90% or even get bonuses. <br /><br />So the only component to determine your fate is the final. And guess what is the format?<br /><br />20 T/F questions, in 15 mins<br /><br />Great, my grade just comes from luck. Even if you don&#039;t know something, you can treat it as a random lottery and you may still get good grade because P( getting a question right) = 1/2. RIDICULOUS. <br /><br />As a result, everyone will very likely to get &gt;90%, and imagine getting overall &gt;90% but ends up a C range, how will you feel? <br /><br />Someone makes joke:<br />100% : A<br />99% : B<br />98% : C<br />97% : D<br />&lt;=96% : F<br /><br />I doubted whether it is joke now<br /><br />These assessments and grading scheme just failed to discriminate students&#039; ability so they are indeed TRASH.<br /><br />Moreover, if you ask why do I put question marks in the proportion of coding interview, that&#039;s because even the professor nor the course website didn&#039;t mentioned the proportion at all. The two coding interview just popped out randomly. We are being told and threatened that they may affect our grade and if we don&#039;t do the interview then we will receive marks deduction. That&#039;s all. It is non-transparent as fuck<br /><br />Ok so now I finally know what the coding interview is for. Please see the updated part (the last paragraph) in &quot;TEACHING&quot; (Update 31/5/2022)<br /><br />Grade has not been released yet. After released I will update. But being a newbie of Java and make quite a few mistakes, very probably I will get C range. RIP my cga<br /><br />Even though the grade is unexpectedly good, I will still regard this course is a trash course since the arrangement is in chaos and ridiculous.",
      "comment_workload": "1.) 9 Labs (2 can be skipped) + 4 PAs<br />Usual programming course work. Nothing special.<br /><br />One interesting thing is, for this course, labs are even harder than PA. I don&#039;t know why. Moreover, in this course, labs and PA lacks instructions. Quite often I just got lost when reading the lab ppt or PA description. TA are also useless so you will got lost easily.<br /><br />2.) Lecture exercise<br />a.k.a. attendance. Not every lectures have but it is pop-up randomly so you cannot skip class unless you have friends to carry you. Even though you submit piece of shit you still get the point. <br /><br />3.) 2 midterm coding demo (+ 2 make-up)<br />Midterm exam. However, it is in coding format. Specifically, you will get the problem description at the beginning of the midterm. Then, you need to write programs to solve it and submit to Canvas. The time limit is short, if you are not familiar enough you may got stuck and cannot finish the tasks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the logistics are in a mess. As mentioned in &quot;Teaching&quot; part. TAs perform badly in handling the exam as they can gives out WRONG TEST CASES. Moreover, we are divided into four timeslots to attend the exam. Some students claimed that the problem in different time sessions are same or similar and this may lead to cheating or unfair situation. As a result, both midterms got make-up<br /><br />4.) Final (+ make-up) <br />As mentioned before, 20 T/F questions. Lottery time<br /><br />Also, as mentioned before, due to two stupid TAs mistaking the exam time limit and the subsequent unfair situation, we got to make-up AGAIN<br /><br />5.) 2 coding interview<br />You will need to propose modifications or new features to existing lab tasks or PA (Maybe prof or TAs are lazy to design the tasks for next year). The first one you need to submit document. The second one is Zoom interview and only 60 out of 109 students need to attend.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />As a 3 cred course, the workload is somewhat equivalent to or even more than comp2011 or comp2012, which are 4 cred course. And the number of exams...BRAVO<br /><br />Moreover, I think the toughest workload is that we need to bear the repeated and repeated mistakes made by the TAs and the unreasonable arrangement from the professor. The psychological impact and frustration is much more heavier than those physical workload. At the end of the course, my heart is just tired as fuck.",
