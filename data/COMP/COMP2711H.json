You learn a bit of number theory, graph theory and propositional logic. Personally, I think this course should go into a bit more depth. The course could have discovered more on graph theory, or asymptotic notations or maybe even into more techniques in proving. It is an honors course after all, the content should be honor worthy.",
      "comment_teaching": "Sunil is amazing. He is a very passionate teacher. He focuses a lot on the motivation and the beauty rather than just presenting the course which I think is quite essential in a course like this. For me, I knew almost all of the contents of this course beforehand, but I still ended up going to his 9am lectures sometimes just to sit in his class.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is just awsome. I messed up my final but still ended up getting an A. I think half the class or more than that got an A-range. Excellent grading for the same content is why I think most people should take 2711H instead of 2711. You&#039;d be learning the same thing while having a greater chance of getting a better grade in this course.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is fair to easy in my opinion. I don&#039;t think I can give an accurate review of the workload because the content wasn&#039;t new to me.

Probably the workload is the asme or even lesser than 2711 :p",

No matter how great you were in calc or other math-related subjects, it means nothing here. The other subjects have some clear methodology for different kinds of problems, but you won‚Äôt find it here. For example, the solution in a function problem is to count boxes.",

Yes, the exams are easy but if discrete math is something new to you, you‚Äôre fucked. <br />Midterm mean: 86<br />Me in midterm: 73<br />It was partly because I got my head stuck at the end, and also due to my bad habit in factorising whatever tf is in the question. But I think the problem is that some of us lack exposure to these kinds of math in highschools. Btw I got in here because I got 5* in M2 so I‚Äôm Y1, maybe that‚Äôs also 1 of the reason<br /><br />Final is unknown yet but I‚Äôm trying my best to make it above mean so I can still at least have an A-",

Btw thz part also overlaps with some math 2000 lv stat prob course, (2411, 21, 31...), which are also in comp curriculum. I think the cse dept should really re-consider to construct a better course structure...<br />(5) is about mod operation. Comp 1000lv prog course gives u insight, but this course gives u a more in-depth knowledge. Better take it serious for its wide application in many other Comp theory courses or even courses in diff subj, e.g. math courses like Abstract algebra, Number Theory.<br />(6) is just an extension of Dse lv m2 version MI. Again, what&#039;s inmportant is the idea. The stupid work flow and clumsy format would not really bother u much once u get the whole picture<br />For (7) I think prof usually doesn&#039;t hv too much time to cover it. Just like in thz sem, basically he just introduced some terminology and definitions. But those fancy terms are stll important. What u hv to do to deal with thz chapter is memorising stuffs as much as possible. In thz way u cen prevent any &quot;surprises&quot; in final exam.",
      "comment_teaching": "I think prof‚Äôs teaching is quite well, but one may first listen him speaking eng with a quite strimg accent..<br /><br />One thing worth to mention is, prof has a quite<br />old-style teaching. For most of the topics, he would like to explain by writing everything on board, but not by using ppt slides or showing his work on projector. Plus he does not really hv a nice handwriting. So one might expect to be really concentrated in the lesson to get the idea.<br /><br />Another thing is, some notes or ppt slides he provides in advance are just other prof‚Äôs work. And he just provide to us for ref, but does not choose to follow them strictly. For some topics like (5) concerning number theory and (7) graph theory he even told us to ignore those slides, but instead search Rosens textbook for the definitions and thms he illustrated in the lesson. So u may really want to get a Rosen e-book just in case. Luckily there are some free online versions ~<br /><br />And he somehow hates people using smart phone in class, but he just managed to accpet student using computers... So u either use phone in secret or use ur computers in class&nbsp;&nbsp;for learning or other(?) purposes.<br /><br />Overall his teaching is good and the course really equip u with solid knowledge of some discrete math tools. But somehow u hv to get used to the prof‚Äôs teaching style.",
      "comment_grading": "20% for assignments (4-5 / sem)<br />35% for mid<br />55% for final<br />A bit diff from most of the math courses<br /><br />As far as I know, most of the people taking thz course would get A range. But i think it is just becoz of their strong academic background...<br />U know, nds and even some locals are really gd at math and logic... <br />(Thz might explain why as an average-lv HK-er, I only can get a A- grade...)<br />(Btw no offense.)<br /><br />One thing gd is, prof is willing to provide pp for us to prepare for mid and final. He may even send u pp in last several sems, as long as sby request in class. And some of the Qs would really re-appear in ur mid / final paper,<br />meaning that u would hv less risk relative to other comp courses when dealing with exams.<br /><br />Overall, hard-working can help for obtaining gd grade, which is good for a comp course.",
      "comment_workload": "For the assignments, he usually delivered it 1-2 weeks before. Like those in C++ class, u may not be able to finish it in last minutes. We are talking abt some REAL stuff here. So just be early planned and better prepared. <br /><br />One thing good is, prof allows or u may say he encourages u to hand in a printed version of ur hw. Plus he specifies that poor hand-writing in hw might cause a lower marks. So u can actually use MS Word or Latex to finish ur hw, which is good for a bad writer like me.<br /><br />For the difficulty lv, some of the hws would be as difficult as those math honor courses (1023, 24, 2131,...). But as the course title suggested, it is also a H course, so u just gotta deal with it.<br /><br />To sum up, u might want to expect to hv a huge workload if u r not really that familiar with math. Even if u r, u still need to work hard to compete with others",
