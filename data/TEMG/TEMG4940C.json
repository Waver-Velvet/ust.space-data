    "description": "Accurate pricing of credit bonds is never an easy task and one that requires precision as well as efficiency given the many variables involved and fast-moving pace of the financial world. Working together with industry veterans with decades of experience in credit analysis and bond pricing, this course aims to establish the role of credit rating migration probabilities and credit spread volatilities to predict changes in bond pricing using Machine Learning techniques. Students will use publicly available data sources, such as Eikon Terminal to export historical financial data for machine learning algorithms training. Students are free to source additional information available in the public domain. Final deliverable is a presentation explaining the key idea of student's ML-based prediction tool for bond portfolio construction, execution and ongoing management. Instructor consent is required for this course.",
