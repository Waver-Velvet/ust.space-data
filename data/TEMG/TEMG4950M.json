    "name": "T&M Corporate Consulting Project: Advanced Air Mobility for Arup Aviation",
    "description": "The vision of AAM is that of a world in which autonomous, affordable, and safe small-scale aircraft become as ubiquitous for the transportation of passengers and goods as cars, motorcycles, and small trucks. The case challenge is for student teams to design new aerial services that supplements or replaces less efficient modes of mobility we rely on today. Students will be equipped with relevant tools and knowledge to solve the case, including MECE frameworks, AAM and vertiport technologies, demand forecasting and services design using Design Thinking and consulting methods. There will be about six class meetings with subject matter experts from the industry. Final deliverable is a final presentation to senior executives of Arup Aviation with potential for solution adoption and internship. Instructor consent is required for this course.",
