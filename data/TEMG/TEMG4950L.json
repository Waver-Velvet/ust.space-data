    "name": "T&M Corporate Consulting Project: Global ETF Dashboard for JPMC",
    "description": "Today, there are over 8,000 ETFs up from 1,000 in 2008. Deciding which ETFs to invest has become increasingly more challenging. To tackle this challenge, students will work as consulting teams to develop a solution proposal and a proof-of-concept prototype using machine learning algo. There will be about five meetings with JPMC sponsors, stakeholders and mentors. Final presentation will be conducted at JPMC before a panel of executives. Students will be assigned into multi-disciplined teams with the support of a seasoned trader and a DDP graduate. Through this experiential project, students will improve consultative problem-solving, design thinking and team-based software development. Instructor consent is required for this course.",
