    "name": "The Rise, Fall, and Contemporary Resurgence of the East Asian Developmental State Model",
    "description": "The East Asian developmental state model represents a unique blend of state-led macroeconomic planning, heavily interventionist industrial policies, severe labor suppression, and capitalist markets. Despite intermittent financial crises, cronyism, and corruption, it has been credited with producing the most impressive economic growth miracles of the 20th century, including but not limited to that of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and even Mainland China since Deng Xiaoping’s experiments with reform and opening up, leading many experts and policymakers to refer to the region as the “growth driver” and “anchor of stability” of the global economy. The model has dominated the political and economic landscape of East Asia from the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, when the rise of neoliberalism gradually shrunk the policy space for state intervention, and successive waves of democratization, as incomplete and flawed as they sometimes were, placed limits on the severity of labor suppression, putting in question the continued feasibility and even desirability of the model. However, in the 21st century, at least three major developments have resulted in the contemporary resurgence of the East Asian developmental state model, albeit in an evolved form: (1) greater acceptance and even demand for increased state intervention following neoliberalism’s retreat in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; (2) increased protectionism as an integral part of the new Cold War race for technological supremacy between the United States and Mainland China (especially in terms of advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence); and (3) the deglobalization and regionalization of value chains following the Covid-19 pandemic. In this course, we will analyze the historical and contemporary application of the East Asian developmental state model in a wide variety of political and economic contexts, its merits and demerits in these contexts, and its potential to further evolve and adapt to new geopolitical and geoeconomic realities. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on state-market relations, industrial and labor policies, and technological upgrading.",
