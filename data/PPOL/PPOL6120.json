    "description": "Capstone project offers a unique opportunity for students to focus on specific areas of public policy and management in Hong Kong, China, or Asia and carry out in-depth studies. Students may expect discussions of issues that have been the cornerstones of the regionsâ€™ development that they choose. HKUST is well-positioned to share the experience of effective governance across Greater China in particular, and Asia-Pacific in general. Faculty supervisors will work with students to reach out to the practitioners in the public sector. Students will apply what they have learnt in class to analyze and solve the problems in the real and dynamic society. The project brings students to reflect on the overall training in the MPM Program and helps them consolidate their knowledge in the area.",
