    "name": "The Politics of the Global Offshore Economy and its Regulation",
    "description": "Through this course, students will be acquainted with the relevant concepts, theories, and approaches necessary to understand and analyze the historical origins and continuing evolution of the global offshore economy, its structural features and characteristics, its main actors, its day-to-day functioning, and its remarkable resilience in the face of increasingly persistent reform efforts. The course will also provide in-depth coverage of the circumstances and main actors behind these reform efforts, and the factors underlying their successes and failures. Considering that Hong Kong itself has been an integral part of the global offshore economy, the course will be useful to those interested in the cityâ€™s role as both a major global financial center and a financial gateway between China and the rest of the world. More importantly, it will be useful to those pursuing careers with national regulatory authorities, international organizations, corporate compliance departments, news media outlets, think tanks, consultancies, NGOs, and other public, private, and civil society sector bodies, as well as to those simply wishing to understand the world better and make a difference.",
