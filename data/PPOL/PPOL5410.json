    "description": "Taught by a former Asian Development Bank (ADB) Head of the Risk Management Unit of the Private Sector Operations Department, this course enables its students to go deep-dive to examine and discuss current public management strategies in dealing with major social issues at the ADB. Specific questions to be explored include: How are policies and processes formulated? How are projects and programs recommended, approved, implemented, monitored, and independently evaluated in an MDB (Multilateral Development Bank)? How results orientation is emphasized at ADB in achieving better quality projects and programs? And how institutional reforms take place at MDBs such as ADB which ensure improved staff resource reallocation and skills-mix changes in meeting evolving operational needs with efficiency and effectiveness? Specific cases will also be discussed to enhance professional skills valued at MDBs.",
