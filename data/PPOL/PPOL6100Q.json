    "description": "This course addresses three fundamental questions about energy policy: Why do we need energy policy? How do governments influence energy systems and their socio-economic and environmental impacts? What is the role of innovation in driving energy transitions? The class begins with an overview of the context in which todayâ€™s energy policies are designed: climate change, environmental degradation, the global competition for natural resources, as well as major successes and gaps in energy innovation. Policy types are introduced through the lens of energy technologies and their past and ongoing development. Students examine the role of data, models, and uncertainties in policy decisions and acquire basic literacy in energy technology and policy assessment methods.",
