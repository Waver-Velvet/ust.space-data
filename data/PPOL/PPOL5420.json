It explores how various political actors and institutions interact with each other in shaping environmental policy. The course is divided into two parts. First, it presents the normative and ideational foundations for environmental politics and discusses the major forms of collective action. Second, it analyzes the governmentâ€™s policy responses to environmental ideas and collective action in the context of capitalist political economy. Students will benefit from the ability to think politically about the environment, which is essential for successful environmental policymaking in practice.",
