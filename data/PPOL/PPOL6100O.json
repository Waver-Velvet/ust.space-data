    "name": "Prevention and Combating of Corruption in Public and Private Sectors",
    "description": "As one of the earliest concerns of moral and political discourse, corruption has long blighted human affairs, and it represents one of the most serious global threats of our time. Its effects are wide-ranging, with corruption having been found to distort human judgment, warp the organizational cultures of governmental and business institutions, undermine economic and political development, increase poverty, compromise human rights, corrode the integrity of economic and political systems, cause extreme inequalities, destroy public confidence in governments and markets, and undercut environmental protection and climate change policies. In this course, we will connect theory with practice to identify the causes and consequences of public and private sector corruption in different policy areas and contexts, and analyze the effectiveness of a wide variety of responses, measures, and strategies designed to prevent and combat it. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on ethics and integrity, good governance, and the role of modern technologies in both facilitating and fighting corruption.",
