    "description": "This course delves into the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) principles and technologies within Mechanical Engineering, beginning with an introduction to AI to establish a foundational understanding of its role in contemporary engineering solutions. With the help of the instructor, students will first explore three pivotal areas: Dimensionality Reduction and Transforms: Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition and Fourier Transforms are taught to enable the simplification of complex data, facilitating more straightforward analysis and engineering application. Machine Learning and Data Analysis: Students will gain critical machine learning skills, including regression and clustering, tailored for mechanical engineering challenges such as predictive maintenance and system design optimization. Dynamics and Control: The course underscores the application of data-driven methods in dynamics and control, equipping students to improve mechanical system performance and efficiency through AI strategies.",
