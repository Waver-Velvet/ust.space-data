      "comment_grading": "Grading policy is interesting. At first, it consists of assignments, midterm and final. However, due to the inconvenience or something likewise, the grading policy excludes the midterm and therefore there was only a mocking midterm exam. When the course came to an end, the assignment grading is full to everyone enrolled. The grade for me is B plus. I may think it is deestimated.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is fair. The assignments are given after class with period of one to two. Besides, each assignment only consists of few pieces of questions, such as four to six. The most satisfactory thing is that the question scheme is similar to final paper. Therefore it is enough to overview the assignments to prepare the final exam well.",
