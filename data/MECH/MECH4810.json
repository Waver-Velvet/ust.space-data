      "comment_content": "The course&#039;s content is about unmanned aviation vehicles (i.e. drones), with significant emphasis placed on quadrotor drones. Chapters indicated with an asterisk means that they are more examined in the exam. Despite the course requires MECH3680 as a prerequisite, most of the contents are more relevant to MECH3610.<br /><br />1. Course introduction<br />2. Introduction to quadrotors<br />3.1. Launch and recovery<br />3.2. Forces and moments on quadrotors<br />4. Control stations<br />5.1-5.2. Sensors<br />6. Control and performance of quadrotors*<br />7. Quadrotor dynamics and rotation*<br />8. Euler theorem for rotation; Rodrigues formula*<br />9. State vectors and state-space form*<br />10. Control equation<br />11. Trajectory planning and Euler-Lagrange equation*<br />12. SLAM<br /><br />To be honest, most of the contents are largely theoretical. I won&#039;t say the course&#039;s content is useless, but if you are lucky enough to have a project/FYDP involving drone design (as in the case of me), the theories give little help. I could find out some theoretical maximums, but the real performance very depends on your configuration and component selection.<br /><br />However, you&#039;ll do gain hand on experience in assembling and tuning your drone, as well as understanding the properties and how to install and tune components. Particularly, as a drone needs much more auxiliary components to fly, the course&#039;s Project 2 is quite helpful for drafting your list of equipment.",
      "comment_teaching": "As you have taken MECH3680, you should be familiar with Professor Yu Hongyu. For more comments about him, please see the following review:<br /><br />https://ust.space/review/MECH3680/view/pxjJIGndnPfjM805aiEpVJNKQEAQowca<br /><br />Unlike MECH3680, Professor Yu used the classroom whiteboard extensively (without any Powerpoint) to deliver about half of the course contents. While there are handwritten notes accompanied with, they are still messy and disorganized. You could still understand part of them if you have taken his lectures, but they are hardly understandable if you didn&#039;t attend lecture.<br /><br />The projects were mostly handled by Peng Jiang and Yiu Kwan Ho. Peng is a Mainland Chinese student who spoke a very thick Chinese accent (to the point that using Putonghua would be much much better), while Yiu is a local who can communicate in fluent Cantonese and acceptable English. Apart from the accent, both of them are really helpful in Project 2. I&#039;m also grateful to mention that Peng reached me out in email to clarify my confusions for the Rodrigues formula.",
      "comment_grading": "Lecture attendance: 3% (Full)<br />Assignments (x4): 8% (All over the mean)<br />Exam (&quot;Midterm&quot;): 34% (50.5/58, mean 34.31/58, median 35.5/58)<br />Project 1: 15% (81.4/100, mean 78.21/100, median 81.3/100)<br />Project 2: 40% (87.63/100, mean 76.5/100, median 77.81/100)<br />â†’Final percentile: 90.68%, mean 72.6%, median 69.99%<br /><br />Lecture attendance was recorded by 10 random sign up. As even the least-participating student gets 2%, this should be fairly trivial. Note that the projects also enforce their own attendance, which is probably counted in the projects.<br /><br />Similar to MECH3680, the assignments are simple and straightforward, and are closely based on lecture contents. You should be able to complete most of them if you understand the contents well. The assignment solutions were released weeks after their submission, which gave you a chance to review and prepare for exam.<br /><br />Despite touted as a &quot;midterm exam&quot;, the planned day for the exam was already late in mid-November. It is further delayed to 28 November 2023 for this year, making it more like a full-fledged final exam (and what I registered in this review). Similar to MECH3680, the 1.5-hour exam is closed-book with cheat sheet allowed, and the questions are rather straightforward. That said, unlike MECH3680, most questions are about calculation.<br /><br />And finally the two group projects:<br />*Your group will be given a DJI drone from the MAE Department in Project 1, and tasked with filming a 3-4-minute video in HKUST. Your video should also be accompanied with a summary of what video-filming skills you have used during filming.<br />*In Project 2, your group is tasked with building a customized drone based on instructions and make it to fly. This involves designing and installing your propeller guards and PID tuning (that&#039;s why I said MECH3610 is more important for this course). After achieving hover stability, you will then test with the sensors.<br />**Typically this is what you could finish throughout 2 months, but achieving full obstacle avoidance is an additional task that would earn you extra points. At the end you&#039;ll do a private presentation to Professor Yu (max. 7 minutes, extra points available for timely completion) and hand in a report, both done as a group.<br /><br />For my group projects, I&#039;m lucky to have a group of helpful teammates who have prior experience in flying UAV and using CAD.<br /><br />The course adopted absolute grading, in which:<br />A+&gt;=90%<br />90%&gt;A&gt;=85%<br />85%&gt;A-&gt;=80%<br />80%&gt;B+&gt;=74%<br />74%&gt;B&gt;=66%<br />66%&gt;B-&gt;=60%<br />60%&gt;C+&gt;=50%<br />50%&gt;C&gt;=40%<br />F&lt;40%<br />Ultimately get A+ for the course. As you can see the A-range is rather wide, so the course (which is part of the AE elective course) is a good GPA and MCGA booster.",
      "comment_workload": "As said by Professor Yu, MECH4810 is not hard in content: it&#039;s only time-consuming to deal with the projects. You will form a 4-5 student group at the beginning of the course for your project, in which you should try your best to find experienced drone flyers and a person who have expertise in CAD (i.e. SolidWorks, Autodesk, etc.). Your limited exposure in CAD during industrial training (and perhaps the notorious MECH2520) means that you&#039;ll have a hard time when it comes to propeller guard design, particularly if you want something curvy (that is more crash-resistant).<br /><br />Particularly for Project 2, the time limit for propeller guard production is rather limited. On-campus 3D printers that can print out large designs are very limited. If your design is too big, you should (A) consider revising your design to make it smaller; or (B) outsource it to somewhere else. Make sure you allocate sufficient time for 3D printing: for our case, the deadline for propeller guards manufacturing is before 3 public holidays, and we only managed to print them out by outsourcing them to Taobao.<br /><br />=====================<br /><br />Apart from the projects, the assignments are generally straightforward, and most of the workload is spent on exam preparation and assignment revision.<br /><br />As a reminder, the course allows expense claim for money spent on producing the propeller guards. While Professor Yu and the TAs will direct you to fill in Finance Office&#039;s online expense claim form, the instructions is pretty lacking.<br /><br />To ensure expedient processing, make sure you print out your completed e-form with a copy of receipt (INCLUDING any proof of online procurement). You should also ask which account Professor Yu is going to deduct from (eg. this time is deducted from the MAE Departmental Development Fund) and provide a hard copy of his response. Print out all documents you may find useful and submit them to the MAE Departmental endorser (should be stated in the form).<br />*Do NOT expect any questions written on the e-form to be answered by MAE Department/Finance Office staff. If in doubt, ask your question in email to your MAE Departmental endorser with the form ID.",

Both are group projects but if you are op enough you can make it an individual project.<br />Project 1 is based around flying a drone around ust and taking a video.<br />Project 2 is basically make your own drone and y33t it around a lab, so find yourself some friends. This also has a final presentation for your group to present the result of the drone built, e.g. how good is the control, how stable it is etc.<br /><br />for a year 3/4 course it has little workload, just need a lot of time for the projects.",
