    "description": "Students will carry out a research project in one of the Chemistry research laboratories under the supervision of a faculty member. This research-based course provides students an opportunity to integrate and apply their chemical knowledge learnt in regular lecture and laboratory courses. At the end of the course, students are required to submit a written report and deliver an oral presentation to document their learning experiences. For CHEM students only. Students should seek instructor's approval prior to enrollment in the course.",

      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Huang 好好人，雖然覆email有啲慢， 但係佢真係好仔細同我解釋每一個topic大概做咩，後面Q&amp;A 都冇話刁難。<br /><br />個post doc 都係勁有耐性教，有咩問題唔識都可以問佢，佢成日秒覆機。presentation/交thesis之前可以send比佢過目下，佢會比啲suggestion.",

      "comment_workload": "我覺得相對都算少（比起其他同學）<br /><br />但係有時候post doc要做完手上面啲lab先有時間教同比我地做，所以成日星期六日夜晚要突然返去做，而且做實驗時間有啲唔穩定 (因為我個topic 同cell 有關， 所以要視乎cell狀態同post doc會突然通知）當然你唔得閒可以唔番，佢有講如果有事可以唔去lab, 但我覺得我有50%係佢手上，所以我點都返去。所以哩個lab個自由度冇其他lab高（li個topic黎講，都要post doc得閒在場幫我地set好曬野）<br /><br />data都係用佢地電腦啲software去測，處理data就用excel同origin, 所以都幾簡單，workload唔大(origin可能要上網自己學下）<br /><br />Workload 比較大係exam period 後面個presentation。 因為我係前一日都有考試，所以整powerpoint時間好趕。<br /><br />後面篇thesis都好簡單，寫完result &amp; discussion,字數都過半",

Prof will visit the lab a few times a day. You can say that the prof is caring... or annoying. I didn&#039;t really learn a thing from the prof. I can tell that pg students were not close to their prof as well. I chose this prof because he speaks Cantonese and he seems nice in lectures.

Both of them took me a lot of time to prepare. As the topics of the research project was very new to me, I need to read a lot of research paper that I was not very familiarize with.",

Project was pretty meh, not too difficult but not very interesting either.<br />there are also 4 library workshops concerning the usage of search engines, Refworks for citations, and softwares for drawing professional chemical structures.",
      "comment_teaching": "RA mentor was super nice and friendly, learned a lot of lab techniques. Prof sometimes came over and checked on progress, he was available if you have questions and seemed friendly. Don’t be fooled though, if he offered you to join his lab as research graduate student, think twice! His mentoring is questionable at best, and I know that because of personal experience and also from past members. Fantastic teacher perhaps, effective PI and good leader? Not so much.<br />Hint: 2210,3210,4240<br />To all the UG comrades, profs speaking canton =/= being good PIs, choose labs that actually do innovative and interesting research, or you&#039;ll suffer.",
