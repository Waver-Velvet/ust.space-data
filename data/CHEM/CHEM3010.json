    "description": "The course covers many major advances, historical developments and contemporary applications of critical concepts in Chemistry. These may range from atomic theory and identification and arrangement of the elements to modern problems such as CO2 and global warming; pollution and environmental clean-up. Unlike other Chemistry courses it will focus on the background to our knowledge, on what experimental evidence our current theories are based, and how old ones were overturned or modified. For science students in their third or fourth year of study under the four-year degree only. Other students with the prerequisites may seek instructor's approval for enrollment in the course.",

      "comment_grading": "30% Online Work and Quiz<br />20% In-class Discussion and Quiz<br />30% Mid-Term Test (Format similar to the lecture quizzes, mainly from Lecture 3-6, printed notes allowed)<br />20% Term Presentations (2-3 ppl, 15 mins with Q&amp;A)<br />Prof. Williams gave half A-range and half B-range, so is very very good grade. So grading I would like to give an A+ for this course.",
      "comment_workload": "Although we gather every 4 lecture time slots, every time we gather will have a group assignment so we need to discuss the answers together after class and this is the main workload come from. Starting from week 5/7, the assignment becomes very hard and some questions require some knowledge in some 4000-level CHEM courses. Fortunately, the online quizzes and the mid term test is quite straightforward.",
