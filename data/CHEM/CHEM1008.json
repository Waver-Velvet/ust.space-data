      "comment_content": "As some background, I never take Chemistry in high school, though I did take Physics and its extension module 2, and have a satisfactory result in HKDSE. Some parts, particularly Chapter 1 and the first part of Chapter 7 interlap with that of DSE Physics.<br /><br />The contents of CHEM1008 are as follows:<br />1. Matter and Energy<br />2. Atoms and Elements<br />3. Molecules and Compounds<br />4. Chemical Composition<br />5. Chemical Reactions<br />6. Reaction Stoichiometry<br />7. Atomic Structures and the Periodic Table (2 chapters)<br />↳Covers the Bohr and quantum mechanics model<br />8. Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structures<br />9. Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces<br />10. Solution Chemistry<br />11. Acids and Bases<br />12. Chemical Equilibrium<br />*Though stated in the introduction, Chapter 12 was never released, taught and examined.<br /><br />The contents were generally easy, though if you are not Science/Engineering students, do spend more time in understanding the theories and calculations. For MECH/AE students, parts of Chapter 7 related to the quantum mechanics model are also related to and taught in the beginning of MECH2410.<br /><br />Despite all of the contents, this is only a very limited part of elementary chemistry for university studies. Particularly, contents like reaction rate, enthalpy (in which enthalpy changes in reactions are always given in questions) and organic chemistry are largely untouched. If you find HKDSE Chemistry papers for revision, you would quickly find yourself overwhelmed.<br /><br />All in all, if you only want to use it to satisfy common core, all is well and good. If you want to use CHEM1008 to get yourself into CHEM1020/1030, you would probably be outperformed by those who studied chemistry in HKDSE.",

Her teaching is generally clear (after all, its a elementary course on chemistry with simple concepts), and she is willing to answer your questions after lectures.<br /><br />As a really large class with around 200 people, in-class interactions between Professor Tsang and students were minimal. She did performed some simple experiments in lectures. If you want to see them, do grab a seat in front of the lecture hall!<br /><br />While there were also TAs in the course, they didn&#039;t make appearance until the final revision tutorials.

Questions are generally easy, though always prepare for some harder questions.<br /><br />The closed-book midterm exam only comes with MC questions, while the also closed-book final exam has 25 MC questions and short/long questions, each consisting half of the exam. The MC questions are generally straightforward, while for the short/long questions, don&#039;t bet everything on calculation questions: there were around 10-20% of conceptual questions that could downgrade a student with insufficient preparation.<br /><br />At the end get an A+ for the course, which is satisfactory for my performance.

She explained the ppt in detail and the pace is quite slow so that it is easy for people that with no chem background to follow.

Topics that are covered include states of matter, atomic and molecular structures, elements, periodicity, quantities in chemical reactions, bonding theories, acids, bases, and solutions.",
      "comment_teaching": "Taking into account that this is a new course, the professor still manages to present and teach well while providing adequate information and resources to students. Prof. Tsang always comes in with a smile and a very bright mood during lectures. She is also very willing to answer questions. Interesting demos and examples are also given during class. The class is never boring even though it is just going through powerpoint slides.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading only consists of quizzes and exams.",
      "comment_workload": "So far the workload has been very manageable. The flexibility of how we study the course allows students to manage how they study the course. There is no required homework regularly. The only thing needed is to review the presentations posted. Ungraded review exercises are also given to students, which are very helpful.",

It would serve as a great introductory course to people studying in Secondary school, or to those who have not touch upon chemistry in university.",
      "comment_grading": "As long as you have done some basic revision, it is almost impossible to get a bad grade. But in the final exam, it could be crushing hard. Yet, if you have done all assignment seriously, it won&#039;t affect your grade immensely.",
