The following are the new concepts this course teaches:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, bohr’s model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, first law of thermodynamics, definition of internal energy, definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behavior, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centered unit cell, face-centered unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram<br /><br />----------<br /><br />The above are primarily from the textbook, Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach, 2nd ed. which the course uses.<br /><br />And I probably haven&#039;t included things from the lecture notes, Professor Li&#039;s lecture notes are so full of content, which deterred me from reading them.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />As you can see there is a lot to learn in this course, some of the concepts are not discussed too in depth. For example, I still have no idea how orbitals actually hybridize. Nonetheless, this serves as a decent introductory course.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />There is a post on the University of Houston subreddit where you can find the download link of the textbook in the comments.

Cuz you would realize what was taught in this course is totally different from what you learnt from high school, especially for those about the orbitals. However, as you proceed to learn those for the final, you will find that what you are learning at that stage is more of the extension of the DSE syllabus, like the Hess&#039;s Law, enthalpy change, standard solution.

But I realized it didn&#039;t work for me to understand the concepts. So, after a couple weeks later, i choose to skip the lectures and watch Youtube videos online instead by searching the materials following the outline of the each lecture ppt slides.

I paid a lot of extra time just to learn the part which require physics knowledge and YouTube helps a lot.<br /><br />Watch organic chemistry tutor in YouTube always helps for clearing contents and learning shortcuts that doesn&#039;t teach during lessons. After watching them, you must need to make your own notes!!! The lecture notes are too wordy. Trying to concentrate the contents into 20 pages can help for revision.<br /><br />Midterm<br />Chapter 1. Chemical Foundations<br />Chapter 2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity<br />Chapter 3. Bonding: General Concepts<br />Chapter 4. Molecular structure and orbitals<br /><br />Final<br />Chapter 5. Chemical Stoichiometry<br />Chapter 6. Chemical reactions in aqueous solution<br />Chapter 7. Thermochemistry: Chemical Energy<br />Chapter 8. Gases<br />Chapter 9. Liquids and solids<br /><br />Sub-topics provided in attachments. They come from my personal notes. My personal notes is very messy. I won&#039;t send that out.<br /><br />Some people said the final is more easier than mid-term but I will say the first half part of final is easy until something beyond dse and a-level which is Ch.9 will make you cry.<br /><br />Tips for people with no physics background like me:<br />understand these basic concepts will help you get through most physics part of this course<br />DSE physics elective 2 &lt;&lt;very important they are laterally the contents of Ch.2<br />1st Law of Thermodynamics (Delta U=q+w)<br />Gas law (PV=nRT)<br />Dalton&#039;s Law of Partial Pressure<br />Kinetic molecular theory<br />Pre-study them help out of ton. I am regretting why I didn&#039;t do so before lesson.",
      "comment_teaching": "JIA, Guocheng:<br />He taught all the contents in the mid-term.<br />POOR ACCENT ALERT! I did not expect he speaks and explained very bad. This made me so confused about what was happening in the lesson. The way he gave us practice questions during lesson was fine but I could not even learn a thing from the lesson just because of his accent and the way he read directly from the ppt slide. Poor teacher!<br /><br />(btw, I laugh my ass off for a long time just because he pronounced &quot;sulphur&quot; as &quot;suffer&quot;. Quite understandable, I am suffering when i hear your accent.)<br /><br />LI, Xiaoyuan:<br />Nice teacher. No more poor accent. I like the way he teaches during every lecture. It&#039;s like a chemistry documentary. He is filled with the passion to teach chemistry. He gives a lot of information for us during lecture unlike Prof.Jia which directly reads from ppt slide. The only drawback is his ppt is hard to condense into a 20 pages notes for revision and no practice questions for checking concepts during lessons.<br /><br />1 tutorials before midterm and final. I recommend you all to attend it. However, while the first tutorial session before mid-term was very good and similar to the exam, the another session before final was absolute trash. They invited postgraduate students to talk about the questions. However, the questions were very difficult and different to the exam and their explanation were very poor which involved very fast pace for difficult questions and unclear explanations.",

The following are the new concepts this course teaches:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, bohr’s model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, first law of thermodynamics, definition of internal energy, definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behavior, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centered unit cell, face-centered unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />The above are primarily from the textbook, Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach, 2nd ed. which the course uses.<br /><br />And I probably haven&#039;t included things from the lecture notes, Professor Li&#039;s lecture notes are so full of content, which deterred me from reading them.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />As you can see there is a lot to learn in this course, some of the concepts are not discussed too in depth. For example, I still have no idea how orbitals actually hybridize. Nonetheless, this serves as a decent introductory course.",

DSE Chemistry<br />Section 2 (MWI) + Section 3 (Metals) + Section 4 (acids and bases&#039; reactions and definitions only) + Section 5 (Combustion reaction only) + Section 6 (MWII) + Section 7 (O.N., definitions of OA and RA, definitions of redox reactions only) + Section 8 (Chemical energy)<br /><br />2. DSE Physics<br />Section A (Heat, general gas laws, kinetic theory) + E2 (Atomic World) + E3 (semiconductors only)<br /><br />3. New topics<br />Ch.1: 3 fundamental laws, different atomic models<br />Ch.2: Bohr&#039;s model, atomic orbitals, quantum mechanic model<br />Ch.3: Formal charge, resonance structure, bond length and strength<br />Ch.4: More on VSEPR theory, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory<br />Ch.5: Molality<br />Ch.7: Definition of enthalpy, PV work<br />Ch.8: Boltzmann constant, Dalton&#039;s law of Partial pressure, gas density, Graham&#039;s Law of Effusion, Van der Waals&#039; Equation<br />Ch.9: Unit cells, close packing of metals, bonding in solids, more on intermolecular forces, phase diagrams, solid structures<br /> <br />Textbook: &quot;Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach&quot; 3rd Ed (Asia edition); 2021<br /><br />我認為這個課程可以讓你温故知新，涉獵不同更高階的化學概念。<br /><br />我的學習資源 (包括全部lecture and tutorial notes、自製 notes、 homework answers ....) :<br />https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10jFLu9sxNJojVQZmYgS42Pu9SboB8XM3<br /><br />**No absolute guarantee that my own notes are 100% mistake-free**",

Organic Chemistry Tutor啲videos出晒名簡單易明，都係不錯的自學資源，不過要逐個topic揾或找playlists，可能miss咗部分subtopics，所以冇特別推薦。上面推介的Chad&#039;s Prep有完整playlist係EXACTLY for 整個General Chemistry course(即係CHEM 1020和CHEM 1030)，而Michel van Bizen對Ch.9 Liquids and Solids 有較深入的講解，cover到Chad&#039;s Prep冇教的內容，所以小弟十分推薦這兩位Youtuber。<br /><br />記得去http://petergao.net/ustpastpaper/index.php?course=CHEM1020找pastpapers，IA在midterm前還提供tutorial questions和selected pastpaper questions，final前就冇，淨係有review notes和selected HW questions的詳細答案。",

      "comment_workload": "沒有Assignment，所以workload比較低。<br /><br />學習建議：<br /> <br />1. 多温習Ch.2、Ch.4和Ch.9，以充分理解這些chapters中的概念，因為這三個chapters是最難的，而且Ch.2和Ch.4在Mid-term exam的weighting是最高的。<br /><br />2. 不要按照教授的建議閱讀全部required reading in textbook並做全部suggested questions in textbook，因為要涵蓋的內容和問題太多，你不會有足夠時間完成suggested preparations。 不過我強烈建議你仔細閱讀每個chapter的 HW 答案，因為 20% 的 HW 題目將分別出現在Mid-term exam和final exam中（題目format可能不同）。<br /><br />3. 不要低估final exam。 雖然final exam的內容整體上比mid-term容易，但final exam的一些題目還是較tricky的。 這就是為什麼兩次考試的mean幾乎相同，也許是因為許多學生認為他們已經在 DSE Chem 學過了，而他們沒有為final exam做好充分準備。<br /><br />4. 參加每次考試前舉行的optional tutorial。 IA 和 TA 討論的問題與考試中的問題非常相似（或至少可以幫助您更深入地理解概念）。<br /><br />5. 考試時要小心。 有些問題（尤其是final exam）較tricky。 在解決之前，每個問題至少閱讀兩次。 不要用你的直覺來回答每一個問題。<br /><br />如果我跟足professor的建議讀書方法，我會給Workload D。<br /><br />**忠告**<br />雖然CHEM 1020算係個好grade course，較容易攞A-range，但唔好諗住有DSE Chem底就hea讀、做deadline fighter都可以有B+/A-，睇下兩次exams嘅mean都幾乎一樣就知道唔係話識咗就一定代表答得啱題目。無論你的底子有幾好，除非你是一個過目不忘的人，你一定要至少在exam前一星期開始溫書和操題目，不然就算溫到通宵你都不會行的。<br /><br />小弟的學習方法 (只供參考):<br />自從9月中後期開始冇上lectures後，小弟每天都花30-45分鐘睇上面recommended Youtube videos來代替lectures，之後會花10-15分鐘望翻相應的PPT，睇下有冇甩漏，有需要時會用空閒時間整自己的notes，歸納youtube videos和PPT的知識重點。<br /><br />每次Exam前至少兩個禮拜就會開始温書 (小弟記性不太好，要早些温)，温熟自己的notes、go through一次homework answers (唔明就思考，再唔明就温翻notes / PPT或睇翻youtube videos)和做tutorial questions。小弟以前有補DSE Chem和Physics，也會找那些筆記內的question banks做幾條 (冇就算啦)，不過其實識做tutorial questions就夠曬數了。最後就狂温notes，温熟所有概念的細節，直到入考場前最後一刻...<br /><br />考試實況:<br /><br />Mid-term:<br />預咗你會見到一大堆判斷型題目 (主要Ch.2, 4)，如&#039;which molecule <br /> has smallest bond angle?&#039;, &#039;which molecule has trigonal planar structure?&#039;, which energy change between shells is the greatest?&#039; 等等，要你逐個choice分析 ，花你不少時間，一定要記得保持鎮定，唔好心急❗❗；計數題唔多，考你代下式、計下比例，難度不高 (P.S. 今次mid-term冇計數題)。<br /><br />諗住mid-term MCQ應該錯5-6題，因為唔知自學work唔work，Ch.2和Ch.4啲題目又鬼咁煩，不少磨了4-5分鐘才揀到choice；睇到49/50後嚇了一跳，以為睇錯39做49，睇返份卷之後發現淨係錯Ch.4的&#039;which molecule has smallest bond angle?&#039;，應該係因為我考試時頭腦不清醒，所以清好concepts+小心就可以拿80%+。<br /><br />Final:<br />難道不太高，考你concepts、計數之餘還要你特别小心，搞清楚問你乜，5個choices好鍾意放哂你會計到不同variables的答案，例如加咗幾多水還是最終volume等 (我就衰咗呢樣😭)，亦好鍾意玩wording，例如Ch.8問volume and temperature的relationship時，要望清楚係Celsius還是Kelvin。記得入考場前一定要背晒equations啲conditions和所有要考的unit cells的details (如fcc有幾多個tetrahedral holes ...)，因為真係會考 (無論你覺得重唔重要)！！<br /><br />奪A / A+小tips:<br />做卷時一定要逐字看 + 寫低重點steps，做完後最少check晒整份paper一次，思考啲steps有冇錯，否則很容易有careless mistakes。",

After the midterm, the content covered in chapters 5-9 is focused on stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solutions, chemical energy, gases, solids, and liquids. However, most of this material has been taught before, which can make it less engaging for students who have already learned it.",
      "comment_teaching": "Overall, I am not satisfied with the quality of teaching.<br />Although I was able to attend all the lectures, it was difficult to stay engaged.<br />For Prof. Jia, his strong mainland accent and wierd way of speaking can make it difficult to understand the content, but his explanations of the content are understandable if you can adapt to his accent and style of speaking. Additionally, he is willing to answer questions after class. <br />For Prof. Li, his spoken English is much better but faster, and he appears enthusiastic about teaching. However, he tends to spend a lot of time on basic knowledge that most students have already learned before, making it difficult to stay engaged during lectures. Additionally,he provides a lot of text on his PowerPoint slides, but he tends to upload them after the lecture. This can make it difficult to know whether to focus on listening to him or looking through the PowerPoint slides during his lectures.",

      "comment_workload": "There were no assignments given in the course, but in order to learn the material well, it was necessary to spend a lot of time on details and basic concepts.<br /><br />For me, I based on their recommendation which consist of reading and exercise.<br /><br />Reading: Actually, textbook is a useful tool if you find anything you can&#039;t understand in powerpoint slides and lectures. For chapter 1-4, I went through all the pages in detailed since there are a lot of new concepts. The disadvatage is that it&#039;s REALLY time-consuming. So for chapter 5-9,&nbsp;&nbsp;I skipped the pages that covered concepts I had already learned and focused on reading the examples.<br /><br />Exercise: Although they call it &quot;homework&quot;,I think its more like exercise. The review questions in each chapter are checking some basic concepts. Read the question and read the answer they provided on canvas is a good way for reviewing. As for the rest of the questions, work them out and check the answers.",

      "comment_content": "The Chem course 1020 covers a range of topics that build upon the foundational knowledge of chemistry. While I don&#039;t have access to the specific details of the course content, I can provide you with a general overview based on my understanding.<br /><br />In the initial weeks of the course, you will likely review fundamental concepts such as compounds, elements, and atoms. This knowledge may be familiar to those who have studied chemistry in high school, even if it was only for a year. It is possible to grasp these concepts without attending classes.<br /><br />As the course progresses, it may shift towards incorporating some aspects of physics, particularly in relation to atomic models. This may include exploring various atomic nucleus models, some of which might have been mentioned in the physics section of the DSE curriculum, specifically in the &quot;Atomic World&quot; topic. However, unlike the high school curriculum, CHEM1020 delves further into quantum mechanics-based models, which can be challenging.<br /><br />Before the midterm, the course is expected to cover all the content related to quantum mechanics models, which is not typically included in the DSE curriculum. Understanding the physical meaning of variables in certain quantum mechanics formulas is necessary, as it helps in developing a deeper understanding of chemical bonding.<br /><br />After the midterm, the course is likely to cover topics already covered in the DSE chemistry curriculum. Compared to the effort required during the midterm period, the final exam may be less demanding, provided that you have revised and practiced using past papers.<br /><br />Please note that the specific details of the course content may vary, so it&#039;s always best to consult the course materials or reach out to the instructor for a more accurate and comprehensive understanding.",
      "comment_teaching": "Chemistry Course 1020 is taught by two professors, Prof. LU and Prof. Huang. Prof. LU is responsible for the teaching before the midterm. His teaching style is highly informative, and he is able to explain complex concepts in a clear manner. However, it is important to note that if you do not have prior knowledge, especially in quantum mechanics, you may struggle to connect the numerous new concepts. Fortunately, Prof. LU is both enthusiastic and professional, and he is always available after class to answer any questions you may have. I am grateful for his patience in addressing my doubts, even though I often found myself lost in a sea of concepts and unsure of how to ask for clarification.<br /><br />On the other hand, Prof. Huang has a distinct teaching style compared to Prof. LU. She strives to make each class engaging and interesting by incorporating relevant experiments. As mentioned in the content, the material she covers is relatively simpler, which leads some students to skip her classes, as I did in the past. However, after attending several of her classes, I found her teaching to be quite fascinating. So, if I happen to pass by the classroom and have enough time, I make it a point to enter and listen to her lecture.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading for Chem course 1020 is highly dependent on your prior background in chemistry, much like other science courses. As a reference, my focus throughout the year was on mathematics and physics. I missed about 1/3 of the classes, including the post-lecture videos. In the week leading up to exams, I only spent one to two days reviewing and referring to past papers. In the end, I ranked around the top 25% with an A-.<br /><br />Therefore, it can be said that this course is less friendly for students without a background in chemistry. However, if you intend to delve deeper into the study of chemistry, the knowledge gained from this course is essential.",

But his ppt covered the details you need.<br />Prof Huang&#039;s teaching is more interesting in comparison (maybe this is also because the content she covered was more concrete). Her lectures often start with a small experiment demonstration as an inspiration to let us think about why what we saw in the experiment happened. The content of that lecture will regard the experiment and she will conclude what we learn in that lecture by explaining the experiment result. This kind of teaching mode makes the course a little more interesting.<br /><br />Btw I think the textbook isn&#039;t really necessary to buy. If you just want to pass the course and do well on the exams, just go borrow the book from the library or find one on a bookshelf in hall and do the exercises. Attending the lectures or watching the video and then review the ppt is enough for this course.

If you had taken those electives then it would be a easy task for you after midterm.",

I just learned from the ppt during lessons. In his lecture ppt, there are a lot of extra things that are not required in the exam. Therefore, it would be difficult to learn from his ppt. He used a green laser pointer to point at the ppt. Sometimes the pointer is too bright and the reflection of it from the ppt nearly made me blind. The ppt would be uploaded after his lectures. btw in every lecture the first thing you would hear from him is &quot;In last lecture, ...&quot;<br /><br />Professor Huang is a good teacher who teaches chapter 5-9. Her tone is also loud and lively but the pitch is too high. At the beginning of every lesson, she may invite 2 students to perform simple experiments. During the lecture, she would let us solve some practical questions, which may be similar to exam questions. Her ppt are neat and tidy and they would be uploaded before her lectures.",

      "comment_content": "CHEM 1020 covers 9 chapters (Ch. 1-9) from the textbook Chemistry An Atoms First Approach. The chapters can be grouped into 4 topics:<br /><br />Ch. 1-2 focus on atoms, namely, the structure of an atom. The concept of atomic orbital will be introduced. The idea of quantum mechanics as a perspective on the Periodic Table of Elements.<br /><br />Ch. 3-4 focus on bondings, namely, the ionic and covalent bondings. These bondings will be viewed and discussed from the atomic orbital perspective. <br /><br />Ch. 5-7 focus on chemical reactions. Students will &quot;learn&quot; about chemical reactions from the perspectives of energy, mass, and type. (&quot;learn&quot; cus you&#039;ve learned them in HKDSE NSS Chemistry)<br /><br />Ch. 8-9 focus on the state of matter. Students will study molecules and atoms in gas, liquid and solid phases. Part of HKDSE NSS Physics content will be covered, namely the part related to ideal gas.<br /><br />Most of the students will find the first 4 chapters difficult. It&#039;s thus highly recommended to find online resources to aid your study in these chapters. (cus you&#039;re not the only one that finds atomic orbital difficult to understand)",
      "comment_teaching": "Both instructors show their passion for both Chemistry and teaching. They do emphasize class order and conduct, especially regarding the noisiness (i.e. No talking/ Talk with a low voice). Prof. HUANG starts her lectures with demonstrations which students may be invited to assist her while Prof. LI starts his lectures right off with the lecture contents. (No demonstration cus, well, there aren&#039;t many experiments or demonstrations related to the atomic structure that can be done in a lecture theatre) One thing to note about the instructors is that you may need to use PowerPoint to aid your understanding of the instructors&#039; delivery. (i.e. accents)",
      "comment_grading": "Grading of CHEM 1020 depends solely on exams, i.e. the mid-term exam (50%) and the final exam (50%). For each exam, 20% of the questions are randomly selected from the homework listed.",

Instructors will list out the questions on the ppt of the first lecture of each chapter.

Prof Li deserves an &quot;F&quot; in teaching while Prof Huang deserves an &quot;A&quot;, so average is a &quot;C-&quot;.<br /><br />Prof Li only upload the materials after lectures including his PowerESSAY. All of us have no idea of whether to jot notes or wait for PPT, so I chose to wait for video recording so that I can refer to PPT and try to follow him. His PPT matches all the bad examples of presentation slides, e.g., using crazy colors and backgrounds, 30 words for one point, etc. He just read aloud words by words and does not explain the proper nouns at all. I have no DSE Physics background and easily get lost during lectures. There are ZERO interactions between students and himself so everyone in the lecture theatre is just doing their own stuffs, no experiments, no in-class polls, etc. What&#039;s even worse is he only focus on those complicated content out of textbooks, with no practice questions in-class and assume we all understand the basics stuff including those Physics. Also, his English accent is terrible, but you can still bearly get what he means.<br /><br />Prof Huang prepares a series of funny experiments during lectures and many in-class poll to let us know we understand the content or not. She explains very clearly if we are in trouble, also welcome us to ask her questions after class, not just ask us to contact the TA. Her English accent and tone is very clear and cute. What&#039;s even surprised me is that she knows Cantonese! She is passionate on interacting with students and used a lot of daily life examples and experiments, even hand-make some models to illustrate some complicated concepts! She is one of the best professors in HKUST in my opinion. However,",

The concept of atomic orbitals may be new to non-Atomic World HKDSE students. Coupled with Jia&#039;s accent, the difficulty of the midterm is higher than that of the final.<br /><br />Chapters 5, 6, 7 are revisions of HKDSE bonding, redox, and enthalpy, and are not particularly difficult. <br /><br />Chapter 8 is about gases, and DSE Physics students can see familiar content such as PV = nRT.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is the most difficult chapter in the final. Solids and how they pack together are rather difficult to visualize. Unit cells are an important concept to grasp.",
      "comment_teaching": "The content before the midterm is taught by Prof Jia, and the content after that is taught by Prof Jinqing.<br /><br />Prof. Jia had a rather strong accent, and that does hinder understanding of the students. To me, his accent often seems &quot;drunk&quot;, but the delivery of his concepts are often acceptably clear. Do be prepared to self-study a bit more for Jia&#039;s part though.<br /><br />Prof. Jinqing&#039;s accent was relatively more clear, and her explanations are clear as well. She does small experiments throughout the semester, which makes the otherwise monotonous lecturing more bearable.<br /><br />Both profs provide polling questions to clear often confusing concepts, which is a definite plus. The questions can also be used to revise for the exams.",

      "comment_content": "These are the fundamentals of chemistry that should have been taught in high school. Forget the chemistry you&#039;ve learnt in dse, this is more like a physics course and if you didn&#039;t do physics(E2) in dse, then you&#039;ll probably fk it up. The best way to do this course is by forming a study group with ppl who did physics in high school and ask them questions like crazily. Or else except you&#039;re very clever or hard-working, you&#039;ll fk it up very hard.<br />I actually think that there should also be an honour course for chemistry, cuz one semester for all these contents for a normal local student is really too much.<br /><br />Course content (copied from other reviews)<br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, the law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, Bohr&#039;s model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, Millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non-electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, the first law of thermodynamics, the definition of internal energy, the definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behaviour, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centred unit cell, face-centred unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapour pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram",

It was a combined version of DSE Chemistry and Physics E2 and also some new concepts including molecular orbital and quantum mechanics etc. Luckily the contents are not cumulative and will not appear in the final exam. <br /><br />Content after the mid-term is more like DSE Chemistry, mostly calculations. The chapter about gases is more like DSE Physics. The chapter about solids and liquids are in-depth version of DSE Chem where calculations are involved in microscopic view.",
      "comment_teaching": "Both Professors are mainlanders. No offence, but their English accent were really bad. I only attended few lectures and the review session of each professor. Li has a better accent than Jia but Li barely asks questions to students, while Jia always do polling questions. I would say buying the Textbook is a must. The textbook explains the concept clearly and it is easy to read. Just study textbook and powerpoints. DO Remember to attend Elaine&#039;s review session before the exam. The information she gave is important, and I discovered that they also include some sample questions in the final exam. <br /><br />Highly recommend to buy textbook.

I skipped some lectures (coz I am lazy) and started revising the textbook several days before exams. Still, I managed to obtain a satisfactory grade. Also, it is not a must to purchase the latest version of textbook (3rd edition) as you can find a majority of homework questions appearing in the older version (2nd edition).

You can see how well his lectures are logically organized, and his effort in trying to make himself best understood. <br />Prof. Li only has a subtle accent, which probably made it easier to understand his lectures.

After you understand the concepts, you can definitely complete all the exam problems with ease. <br />Chapter 5-9:<br />Since most stuff in Chapter 5, 6 is from DSE, I just scroll through the notes and skip through the lecture videos. I think reading the notes are kind of unnecessary if you have studied DSE Chem already. Just do the questions. For Chapter 7, the energy part uses some equations from thermodynamics (PHYS1112 have taught) so its quite easy too. Chapter 9 is just general gas laws stuff.

However, one problem is that the slides he uploaded on Canvas are incomplete at first, and upload the full version after the chapter is finished. This is not very good if we want to revise what we have learnt right after the lesson.<br />For Prof. Huang, she took a good approach to suggest some daily examples and its relationships in chemistry. She even made a demonstration for one of the inspirations (However, it is a demonstration of mixing bleach and alcohol, that has potential health risk. She even did the experiment WITHOUT any protective gears, despite she told us do not reproduce at home and she only mixed a small amount).",

The following are the new concepts this course teaches:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Chemical Foundations<br /><br />Laws – law of definite proportion, law of multiple proportions<br />Older atomic models – billiard ball model, plum-pudding model, Rutherford model, bohr’s model<br />Experiments – cathode ray tube experiment, millikan oil droplet experiment<br /><br />Chapter 2: Atomic Structures and Periodicity<br /><br />The first part consists of chapters 1 and 2 of DSE E2 physics.<br /><br />Second part is about quantum atomic model:<br /><br />Schrodinger’s equation, wave function, atomic orbital, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, quantum numbers, Aufbau principle<br /><br />The chapter also teaches how to use QM model to account for trends in the periodic table, for instance, why electronegativity is highest at the top right, why atomic size is the largest at the bottom left etc.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Bonding: General Concepts<br /><br />Bond length, definitions of non-polar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and ionic bonds, lattice energy, bond energy, lewis structure, resonance structures, formal charge, naming of compounds<br /><br />Chapter 4: Molecular Structure and Orbitals<br /><br />VSEPR model, hybridization of orbitals, sigma bonding and pi bonding, molecular orbital model, bond order, paramagnetism<br /><br />Chapter 5: stoichiometry<br />(Nothing new here)<br /><br />Chapter 6: Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br /><br />Hydration of ions, strong, weak, non electrolytes, Molarity vs Molality, complete ionic equation, net ionic equation, Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, non-whole number oxidation numbers, electron donors and acceptors in redox reactions<br /><br />Chapter 7: Chemical Energy<br /><br />Heat, work, state function, extensive property, first law of thermodynamics, definition of internal energy, definition of enthalpy, constant-volume calorimetry<br /><br />Chapter 8: Gases<br /><br />Pressure, barometer, manometer, Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Avogadro’s law, ideal gas law, standard temperature and pressure (STP), Dalton’s law of partial pressures, kinetic molecular theory, effusion and diffusion, real gases behavior, van der Waal’s equation, compressibility<br /><br />Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids<br /><br />London dispersion forces, polarizability, capillary action, cohesive and adhesive forces, crystalline solids, amorphous solids, unit cell, x-ray diffraction analysis of solids, Bragg equation, atomic solids, metallic solids, network solids, Group 8A solids, molecular solids, ionic solids, hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure, cubic closest packed (ccp) structure, simple cubic unit cell, body-centered unit cell, face-centered unit cell, net spheres, band model, substitutional alloy, interstitial alloy, doping, p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductor, p-n junction, holes(semiconductor), octahedral and tetrahedral holes, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of fusion, definitions of melting and boiling, normal melting and boiling points, supercooling and superheating, phase diagram<br /><br />----------<br /><br />The above are primarily from the textbook, Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach, 2nd ed. which the course uses.<br /><br />And I probably haven&#039;t included things from the lecture notes, Professor Li&#039;s lecture notes are so full of content, which deterred me from reading them.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />As you can see there is a lot to learn in this course, some of the concepts are not discussed too in depth. For example, I still have no idea how orbitals actually hybridize. Nonetheless, this serves as a decent introductory course.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />There is a post on the University of Houston subreddit where you can find the download link of the textbook in the comments. Just search &#039;An atoms first approach 2nd edition&#039; there.",
      "comment_teaching": "I only attended three lectures. I never asked the TA any questions. So I apologize for not being able to give a grade that reflects accurately the teaching quality.<br /><br />What I remember is that Professor Li had a very heavy accent.<br /><br />And they also recommend doing some pre-study before attending the lectures, which I think is not humanly possible because there is too much to digest. Just learn at your own pace. <br /><br />In case you need them, recordings of lectures are uploaded after a few days to possibly a week. Lecture notes are uploaded only after the professor has finished teaching the chapter.<br /><br />You can find the lecture notes, answer keys to textbook questions and some past papers here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QoAhy0lvGzuIj1waii6w3XCyfiIsj6Nc?usp=sharing<br /><br />Although you need not attend/ watch the lecture videos, I do recommend attending/ watching the tutorial sessions held before each of the exam. The questions demonstrated are similar to those in the exams.",

What&#039;s even better is that the answers to those questions are exactly the same in the exams as well, they don&#039;t change the numerical values even if it&#039;s a calculation problem.<br /><br />Revise the notes only if you have time and want to get a really good grade, the exams are based on the content of textbook. (I didn&#039;t do that except for the first chapter, still enough for an A+)<br /><br />And if, for some reason, you still have time left. I suggest reviewing subtle concepts that you don&#039;t normally think will be asked, e.g. formal charge(in the ppt they said it&#039;s optional to learn), the definition of atomic mass unit, formula mass and molar mass, definition of acids and bases, determination of direction of work done from a chemical equation, factors affecting vapor pressure (the textbook does not mention what factors won&#039;t affect it). To my surprise, the concepts I listed above were asked in mid-term and final.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t follow the professors&#039; teachings, don&#039;t even bother attending/ watching the lectures. But attending/ watching tutorial sessions held before each of the exam is highly recommended, because the questions they teach there are similar to those in the exams.",

However, please get familiar with the First Law of Thermodynamics, Gas Laws, KMT which are supposed to be new for students without Physics Background. <br /><br />The last chapter is difficult in some of the parts, the calculations of solids require in-depth understanding of each cubic structure. <br /><br />Key to secure grade: <br />read textbook <br />read the slides <br />work on exercises<br />attend lectures and listen to talk show <br />make some notes <br />work on tutorial and review questions",
      "comment_teaching": "I am so sure that you will be amused by Xiaoyuan teaching. He is the Chair Professor of the Chemistry Department and he has a long teaching experience.<br /><br />He prepares well for all lectures and able to deliver the key concepts of each chapter with in-depth explanation and the use of graphics and animations. The lecture PPTs include the details of each chapter and give supplement to the content which are not mentioned in the textbook. The lecture PPTs are designed with proper and rational logic, which are easy to follow and understand. The lecture PPTs assist the Professor to point out the fundamental concepts of each session of every single chapter. <br /><br />The presentation skills of Xiaoyuan, I would say it&#039;s funny and causes lots of laughter. He has a special voice and speaks loud during lectures. He behaves like a proactive child and presents the content with fluctuations and intonations. As a Mainland Professor, his English is much better than those local professors and easy to understand. Sometimes he makes good use of his voice to grab students&#039; attention. <br /><br />Some of his pronunciation are quite funny indeed :) Enjoy lectures and you definitely get lots of rewards. Feel free to raise questions through email or just face-to-face. <br /><br />Xiaoyuan also prepares review and tutorial sessions before exams, showing that he is helpful and responsible. <br /><br />By the way, Xiaoyuan is energetic:) Really a good professor and teacher in my first semester study in the University.<br /><br />For TA Elaine, she particularly worked on the tutorial session before exams, working on examples of exam-oriented questions. Better not to miss her tutorials.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is actually fair and reasonable for a 3-crd course. <br /><br />But be aware of the traps of questions which may appear in the examinations, key concepts and definitions are examined. <br /><br />If you score above mean, a B grade or above is not a difficult task. But if you score high in mid-term(which is much more difficult than final) and get a reasonable score in final, A range should not be a problem.<br /><br />Grade: B+ (I did slightly above mean in midterm but over 1 SD in final, so it&#039;s standard curve-shape grading, you know the grading for most Year 1 Courses are very strict compared to those major courses)",
      "comment_workload": "Actually the workload is reasonable. <br /><br />Just read and understand the details of the lecture slides and the textbook examples. Try to apply the concepts learnt by doing the self-practice provided in the textbook and read the sample answers to grab the required concepts. Please do the self-practice provided during the tutorial sessions since some of the questions are similar to those appear in the examinations. <br /><br />However, to secure your grade, hardwork is still need. Students experience difficulties when they studied the first few chapters of the course. Try to understand and memorize the concepts and logic, make some key notes and work on the exercises for further consolidation.",

It really helps to fill in the atomic orbital theory, a very important part of chemistry that is completely cut from the HKDSE syllabus. <br />The professor highly recommends the book &quot;Chemistry: An Atom&#039;s First Approach, 2e&quot;.<br /><br />Below is the list of chapters: <br />1. Chemical Foundations<br />2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity<br />3. Bonding - General Concepts<br />4. Molecular Structures and Orbitals<br />5. Stoichiometry<br />6. Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry<br />7. Chemical Energy<br />8. Gases<br />9. Liquids and Solids<br /><br />Some might describe this course as more similar to a quantum physics course.<br /><br />It is highly recommended that Chapter 8 Gases is studied in conjunction with thermodynamics in PHYS1112, since studying them together can help reinforce the understanding of the concepts in the chapter.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Li Xiaoyuan is a very impressive teacher.<br />His charisma and his unusually loud and accented voice combined makes him one of the most adorable and attention-grabbing lecturers. Or more accurately, master of his Talk Show!!<br />His lecture notes actually contain more details than the textbook that he repeatedly recommends during class, and while it is possible to be confused during lectures, he does an excellent job clarifying confusing concepts face to face.<br />Personally I really like this lecturer, and hope you guys can be taught by him!",

Also, there were only 13 students enrolled so the lecturers welcome students to ask questions and have some interaction. This course started the first lesson in july, so there may not have enough time to teach to the all the topic, thus the content is much fewer. Among these chapters, Chapter Review are the basic common sense about math and science taught in junior secondary school. Chapter 1 are some history of Atomic model which was learned in compulsory part of dse physics. Chapter 2 introduced the atom (wave particles duality, Atomic orbitals, electron spin etc.) which partly learned in elective part of dse physics. Chapter 3 and 4 are new things about bonding ( VSEPR, Lewis structure, hybridization and molecular orbitals). Overall, these topics are mainly related to high school physics but not chemistry ( but it is still a chemistry course without any Chemical equation)",

His teaching style was compatible to private tutorial school teacher. He printed some self made colored lecture notes for us and then wrote some notes on it. We then copied the notes, but the annotated notes usually release on canvas after a few days. He will bring some apparatus to the classroom and do experiment, although only for once throughout the whole. Also he was nice to ask questions.",

      "comment_teaching": "Prof Li has only 2 one-hour lectures per week, which he always claimed it is insufficient for him to cover all materials. Instead of focusing on the most difficult parts, he chose to keep on repeating topics that are &quot;important&quot; yet should be understood by most simply by reading the textbook. He seemed to be not so good at time management as he always overrun his lectures, and eventually cut off one topic from the syllabus due to time shortfall.",
      "comment_grading": "I guess the standard university grading guideline was adopted. People complained about the poor grades received after the release of grades as usual for science courses. As for grading scheme, simply the average of your midterm and final score.",
      "comment_workload": "Many complained it was too much for a 2-credit course. I think it is rather reasonable though. The only difference between Prof Li&#039;s CHEM1020 and probably the rest of your courses is that he expects everyone to read through the chapter before he starts one, which I believe not many people have time to do so in UST. As long as you follow his instructions in reading the textbook chapters, you will find it fine to follow his lectures.",

The important part of the course is actually the tutorials hold by IA. It is very useful to the midterms and final as it includes the most related content for the test and final. I think it will be even better if you read through and understand the lectures first before the tutorials since you can ask about contents you dont understand and the IA is actually explaining it better and she will tell you it is not tested in the test or exam if the content you asked is not related. And i would highly recommend to attend the tutorials a few times especially if you are not familiar with the things taught.

A number of experiments were performed during class, so those lectures were really interesting. <br /><br />Miss Lee, Tsz Kiu is the IA of the course teaching in the tutorial classes.

Therefore, it could really help if you can get a high mark in midterm.<br /><br />Also, it is reminded that tutorial class can ONLY help you get a satisfactory score. Reviewing all lecture slides is a must for those aiming A. Details of complex formulae excluded from the tutorial slides can be ignored, but their variables and the uncertainty inequality should be recited as it was tested. <br /><br />One hint for the midterm exam is that always think more and deeper using the basic theory. Examples used in class to illustrate the theory are chosen to be simple, but questions are usually one level higher in difficulty.",

Only 2 assignments, one before midterm and one before final. <br /><br />Mistakes in assignments do not significantly affect the grade as each assignment only accounts for 5% of the total score.

Personally I feel his classes are well-prepared, and it is always quite comfortable to have a native speaker as instructor for this kind of courses. <br />He suggested us to go through the textbook after each class, but I personally think it will be more effective if you only do it with the parts that you don&#039;t fully understand.<br />Also, personally I think the professor dug WAY TOO DEEP into the quantum parts, which I suspect is because of his own interest of research. <br /><br />Prof. HUANG is also friendly and helpful. Someone complains that she only read the PPT. But I occasionally sit in the front of the LT and see her own notes for teaching. I bet it is much more elaborate than most of the students. In addition, she designed experiments to add some fun to the class, some of which are quite interesting.<br /><br />Ms. Tse Kiu Lee is the best IA I have ever had.<br />Ms. Tse Kiu Lee is the best IA I have ever had.<br />Ms. Tse Kiu Lee is the best IA I have ever had.<br />I highly recommend everyone to attend her tutorials.<br />And she is always more than willing to help us with all kinds of issue, whether about the knowledge itself or the controversy caused by the annoying “X of the above”.",

He just read out his lecture notes hurriedly without explaining the concepts clearly. Furthermore, there were hardly any exercise questions in his lecture notes, making it difficult for you to prepare for the midterm exam.<br />Most of Prof. Huang&#039;s part(after midterm) was covered in the high school. There were adequate amount of examples and exercise in her lecture notes for you to understand the concepts.

They&#039;re just here to dwarf you, make you look stupid, and push towards the inevitable inferiority complex!!!<br /><br />Content is very very very disorganized.

Other students are either sitting at the back sleeping, or just skip all the lectures cuz the lectures are simply useless as fuck.<br /><br />✅ On the other hands, the TA was very helpful and he was more able to explain all the concepts. So every time I slept in the lecture, and after that I just asked the TA what Jia was fucking murmuring about. My beloved Prof Jia Jia, don&#039;t u fucking feel ashamed when the TA gets sooooooo popular after the lecture while the prof just stands asides and watches the TA surrounded by the crowd of confused students asking questions? The TA SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROFESSOR instead. I give a D, not an E, just because of the TA.",

Really easy especially if you&#039;ve self-studied HKAL Chem. It&#039;s essential to do the homework they put on LMES (Canvas in coming years?) though. Those are really helpful for understanding concepts and seeing if you&#039;re missing stuffs required for exams.",
      "comment_teaching": "Very slow and unclear teaching. Prof is too self-aware to essentially give you any damn. Also speaks too softly and too muffled. Not gonna take attendance so tbh no loss skipping lessons (especially if you have one or two friends who insist on attending all lessons). Also pronunciation -- abandon all hope of trying to understanding everything prof says. Siginificant figures and oshun (oxygen) are all you&#039;re gonna get.",
      "comment_grading": "Not the most lenient but still really good. If you&#039;ve gone through the stuffs thoroughly then it shouldn&#039;t be a problem at all. Remember to do the homework (no need to hand-in -- they have the answers posted). Exams consist of MCs (up to 8 choices I remember) and LQs. The time for examinations are very long and to an extent, excessive. Most of us had at least 20 minutes remaining after checking twice. Good idea to leave early since your mistakes are mostly gonna be careless ones and YOU&#039;RE NOT. GONNA. NOTICE. THEM. Deal with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just mind the significant figures and A range shouldn&#039;t be difficult.",
      "comment_workload": "Not the lightest but still very light. 2 assignments, and midterm + final. Assignments are in exam formats so very good for practice actually. Just remember to hand in on time and it&#039;ll be fine usually.",
