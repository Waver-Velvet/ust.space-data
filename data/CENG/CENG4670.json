      "comment_content": "The content of this course is pretty independent of other courses.<br />It is simple and in my opinion you could even take it even if you have no science/engineering background.<br /><br />The content is not math-heavy at all and is even more dumbed down than even some 2000-level courses.<br /><br />The content is very practical and you can actually apply what you learned about excipients and drugs, etc to daily life (Reading&nbsp;&nbsp;medicine labels). If you have an interest in pharma this is a great course to take.",
      "comment_teaching": "His teaching is actually OK. I agree with the other comments that his teacher is in-class teaching is rather monotone and he speaks a bit too slowly.<br /><br />Another problem is that he will often go off on a tangent and it can be hard to know if some things are tested on the exam or not - just ask if you are confused.<br /><br />Overall his quality of teaching is quite decent and you can see that at the very least, he is passionate about his teaching. There are many many worse profs at HKUST.",
      "comment_grading": "Overall my grades were:<br />10% - Tutorial: 8/10 + 0SD (mean:8)<br />20% - 3x Homeworks: 52/60 +1SD (mean: 41.7) <br />20% - Midterm: 89/100 Highest in class (mean:52.9)<br />50% - Final: 77.5/100 +2SD (mean:55.83, highest 86.5)<br /><br />I got an A+, the main differentiating factor is the finals. My tip for this class is to really spend a lot of time revising for the finals as it is cumulative (I spent about 5days watching all the lecture videos).<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with the other reviews at all on the grading stuff.<br />This is an EASY class and a lot of people don&#039;t put in effort for this class at all. For instance, more than half the class left the final exam an hour early and I only finished at the very last minute.",
      "comment_workload": "Insanely light. I literally didn&#039;t attend class because it is much easier just to 1.5x the recordings. My preparation for both MT and finals was to just watch all lecture videos and make notes ONCE.<br /><br />He releases in-class tutorials without notifying you, but you can just by doing the PPT and then submitting it. This way you can still score participation even if you are not physically present in class &lt;- So basically no attendance",

      "comment_content": "He didn&#039;t change the content, and neither did the guest lecture.<br /><br />SOOOOOOOOOOOO boring. Gave up listening after September. Reading the lecture slides is already enough.<br />But there are tutorial quizzes(not quizzes but more of a random assignment, where accuracy does not matter but you have to finish and hand it in, then you will get full), so you still have to go to classes.",

      "comment_teaching": "Although Professor LAKERVELD&#039;s teaching is a bit boring, he always thoughtfully answers students&#039; questions. He encouraged people to understand the textbook concepts, which was quite helpful to me. I think he can include more case studies in manufacturing to broaden students&#039; horizons on complicated manufacturing processes.<br /><br />Aviva, the guest lecturer, is pretty great at teaching. He used some jokes while teaching complex manufacturing concepts.",
      "comment_grading": "The mid-term quiz covers Ch 1-5, while the final exam covers everything.<br /><br />Mid-term quiz: (20%)<br />Me: 17.2/20, Average: 11.17/20<br />Final exam: (50%)<br />Me: 42.5/50, Average: 32.13/50<br /><br />Three assignments: (30%) <br />Me: 54.5/60 <br />Result: A+<br /><br />Although it is not a challenging course overall, students need to PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to the lectures since the most tricky and difficult questions require an excellent understanding of the lecture materials, especially the mid-term exam.<br /><br />Both exams involve MCQs and Open discussion questions. MCQs are for tricky concepts, while open discussion questions focus on long calculations and concepts easier than the MCOs. Beware: Long calculation questions require a great understanding of materials rather than memorizing the formulae.",
      "comment_workload": "Light to medium workload.<br /><br />For the mid-term quiz, you pay attention to lecture materials and revise them. It would be alright.<br /><br />For the final exam, you must memorize and understand all the functions of excipients. Other things would be similar to the mid-term quiz.",

His ppt is not quite useful he expands a lot during the lecture. Also, he assumed you have taken previous ceng courses about separation process (CENG3210 and CENG 2220) before taking this course so the prerequisite of chem1020 is totally fake.

He is more of a CENG guy and he works with crystallization for years. He elaborates quite a lot in class. Although sometimes his low monotone makes it harder to concentrate, the lecture video helps you recap what he said in class, and they&#039;re pretty useful. Both guest lectures by Prof. Henry and Prof. Aviva are both interesting. They both have experience in pharmaceutical industry, one works in formulation of drugs in Jacobson and one works as a consultant for investment in pharma industry.

MCs can be tricky, so make sure you have clear concepts in mind (as long as you pay attention in class, you should be fine).
