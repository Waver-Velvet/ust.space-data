    "description": "Science encompasses subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, with boundaries between them becoming increasingly blurred over time. Engineering applies science and math to solve problems, resulting in interdisciplinary fields that offer a broader perspective. The course integrates materials science, chemical engineering, thermodynamics, bioengineering, environmental engineering, and microelectronics. For BIEN and CENG students in their third or fourth year of study only. Instructorâ€™s approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
