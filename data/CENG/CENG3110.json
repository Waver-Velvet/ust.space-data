      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Gao has a good english level to deliever what are necessary for us to understand this course. And he is indeed a true expert with respect to the control field.<br />The course slides however seem to be a bit redundant, since some contents may never appear in both assignments and examinations, though they can be very scaring at the first glance.<br />TA are very responsible. The slides they provide are self-contained if you want to have a quick recap and understanding of this course.",
