      "comment_content": "I honestly don&#039;t know why I took this course but I don&#039;t regret it after I got my grade üòÅ. I thought environmental engineering concepts would be useful to know in this modern world where sustainability is promoted everywhere but turns out all that is bs and people always wanna save some $$. Anyways, this course is very surface level into environmental engineering and utilises some chemistry concepts. The main topics are:<br /><br />1. General chemistry (pH, equilibrium, pKa, acids and alkali)<br />2. Units and Dimensions<br />3. Air pollution and its treatment devices<br />4. Mass balance (Probably the hardest topic)<br /><br />MIDTERM<br /><br />4. Wastewater (split into 3 parts --&gt; Drinking water, river water and&nbsp;&nbsp;wastewater engineering)<br />5. Solid waste (very briefly covered)<br /><br />FiNAL",
      "comment_teaching": "I would say Frank is one of the best professors I have had at UST so far. He is able to teach in a way that is both informative and funny, which keeps the class&#039;s attention from time to time. He also is very easy to contact after lecture hours with his email and office hours being convenient for students to access. He is also chill about grading and doesn&#039;t want this course to be too much pressure on the students so he&#039;ll even delay certain deadlines if he feels it is too tight. <br /><br />Although he teaches in a nice way, the contents of the course itself are so dry that I sometimes lose my attention whilst he is talking.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is quite soft and it is not hard to score into the A range with some dedication. <br /><br />There is <br /><br />3 assignments (10%) : Mean is usually 100%, assignments are usually easy and you get at least 2 weeks to complete it<br /><br />Presentation 15%) + Report (15%): Unreleased grade. This is honestly the most time consuming part of the course<br /><br />Midterm (20%) - Mean : 39.32 My score: 42.5 (Mean was quite high that time)<br /><br />Final (40%) - Grade not released<br /><br />Final score: A+<br /><br />I think if you can dedicate time on your presentation and report more than is required, it would make Frank happy and the grade you get will boost up compared to the rest. If you have decent presentation skills you will be far ahead of other groups for the presentation as Frank really values that when you are presenting. Otherwise, just be consistent with gaining your knowledge over the semester or else you will fall behind. I only had loose connection with each topic and just knew surface level stuff, so this course is good in that regard as it actually offers an introduction into the world of environmental engineering.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is not too bad before midterm. Only content is taught and there is 1 assignment to do. The most time consuming part of this whole course is the presentation and report. If your group is good and hardworking it should be fine, but otherwise it can be very heavy workload. The report and presentation usually happens around the end of semester and it is not impossible to do. 1-2 weeks of focused work with your group should be enough to do a good job. The workload fluctuates for this course, with it being lighter before midterms and right before finals, but pretty heavy leading up to the presentation and report.",

He knows when to ask questions and crack jokes to reel back students&#039; concentration, and I think that&#039;s a really important skill that not many other lecturers have perfected. While he does tend to go fast at some times, he does recognize the picked-up pace and pauses the lecture momentarily to make sure everyone&#039;s on the same page, whilst answering and reviewing any questions or content asked by anyone. Furthermore, he always provides local examples of content talked about in lectures such as the Shing Mun Water Treatment Plant, which is helpful.",

The immense workload all falls under the oral presentation and group project. This took way longer than expected for me and my groupmates, and honestly, this is why this course should be taken by those who wish to major in Environmental Engineering. I spent 2 whole days of my study break on this project. The research, report, and all the factors to consider took way too long. However, with perfect time management, it will be easy to score a high grade in this course.",

      "comment_content": "I honestly took the course due to the lenient grading policy. Once I am actually enrolled though, getting a good grade is not as easy as all the reviews here make it seem. The PowerPoint presentations are a bit too superficial; the professor will usually annotate them quite heavily to convey a multitude of things that are not contained in the actual presentation. You may consult the textbook if you want more details, only to find out that the textbook is almost 1000 pages long, so long that its difficult to know where to even start. The professor does entertain questions in the lecture though, but my point is that studying independently is harder than it sounds.",

      "comment_content": "The content of this course, in my opinion, is quite difficult for an introductory course. Topics (like mass balance) need to be understood and practiced thoroughly to approach the exam questions.<br /><br />The content includes:<br />1) Introduction<br />2) Units and mass balance<br />3) Environmental chemistry<br />4) Air pollution control<br />5) Water/ Wastewater treatment<br />6) Solid waste treatment<br />7) Waste-to-energy technology<br /><br />A solid background in high school chemistry is definitely required.",
      "comment_teaching": "Frank is quite nice and you can tell he is passionate about the subject. He is very approachable and is willing to answer doubts. He is also considerate of any issues students have such as time conflicts and problems with the online system. <br /><br />However, the teaching itself tends to be a bit boring. I found the PPT to be rather disorganized. There are usually 60+ pages and it is difficult to separate the useful information from pages of statistics. And due to the scattered nature of the lecture notes, there is very little flow in the teaching. It can seem like you are jumping from one topic to another.<br /><br />Attendance is not mandatory and there are not many people who attend the lecture. Many students prefer to self-study.<br /><br />There are two TAs who taught one tutorial each just to satisfy their teaching requirement. The rest of the tutorials are all taken by Frank.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading scheme:<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Homework - 10%<br />Mid-term examination - 20%<br />Group project and presentation - 30%<br />Final examination - 40%<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />HOMEWORK<br /><br />The homework assignments had a mix of easy and difficult questions. Similar questions can be found in the notes and textbook. There were a total of 4 assignments but the last one was scrapped due to time constraints.<br /><br />EXAMS<br /><br />The exams, similar to the homework, also consist of a mixture of simple and tricky questions. <br />You are allowed one A4 sized cheatsheet (2 sides) for the midterm and 2 sheets (4 sides) for the final.<br />The marks of the final exam were not released. <br /><br />GROUP PROJECT<br />The group project is quite important and can help you bounce back if you performed below average in the midterm. If you do the research thoroughly and have a well presented project, I believe it is relatively easy to get a good grade. <br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Overall, despite having only a very loose understanding of a lot of the topics, I still got a pretty decent grade.",
      "comment_workload": "I found the workload to be high for an introductory/common core course. <br /><br />The group project involves selecting a type of waste from a list given by Frank and then coming up with a way to treat this waste. You need to prepare both a presentation and a report. The presentation should be about 30 mins long (5 mins per person + 10 mins Q&amp;A). The main areas covered in the report should be 1. abstract and introduction, 2. treatment methodology, 3. advanced treatment process, 4. cost evaluation and comparison and 5. key highlights. Naturally, the project, if done properly, requires time and effort. However, I think it is easily manageable with proper planning. <br /><br />What I found more time consuming were the assignments and studying to actually understand the content. A lot of it was complex and took a lot of practice to grasp. Being a required course for Chemical &amp; Environmental Engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;majors, a large portion of the class is comprised of year 4s. Many of the concepts covered, they have already learned so it is tougher as a year 1 to catch up to the rest of the class.",

The delivery and teaching was so bad that all these concepts seem half-assed. But if I was to be objective, I&#039;d say the content is decent for the average engineering major. It covers a good range of scientific concepts and engineering concepts including some techniques in decision making. However, for people with no chemistry background, the course seems like a nightmare because (at least in some chapters) you need high school level chemistry to attempt the questions. The course seemed to overload on too many of these concepts. For instance, the lecture on fate and transport included too many physical and chemical properties with no time given to individual ones. At other times, the content was too easy to even bother listening. AVOID THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE NOT A PERSON WITH A CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND. The last few chapters were absolute garbage and I learned absolutely nothing from them. If you are a senior in CENG, then this course is an easy A content wise.",
      "comment_teaching": "Probably the worse teacher I have had yet in UST. Not only is his delivery of the course monotonous and boring, he barely makes an effort to get some continuation into the concepts. It honestly feels like he jumps from one chapter to the next without you even realizing. He spends too much time playing videos and reads out the ppt for the rest of the time. The bits of information he adds are absolutely useless. The worked examples he does in class barely help you do the questions yourself. He BARELY HAS A GRASP ON ASSESSMENT. The students are clueless on what exactly is expected from the assessment and what techniques are required. The resources he adds are barely useful but are flooded with useless articles.<br /><br />The TAs are decent and will go through different practice problems step by step. Although they seem clueless for most of the time as well, they are way better than the professor.",

However, the difficulty level was extremely varied and the 2nd exam was way easier than the rest. The mean is very high but since we don&#039;t the grade boundaries, I cant tell if that matters.<br /><br />There were supposed to be three assignments but there were only 2. The format is odd and we barely have any idea on how to attempt. The mean is still oddly high. I do not know what happened to the case study or the class participation (we were to write answers on pieces of paper in class).<br /><br />Mean overall is high so if this course is curved, the grading is screwed up because you are competing against 3rd and 4th year engineering majors. <br /><br />My breakdown:<br />Exams:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) 70/100 (mean 71.9)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) 100/100 (mean 77.9)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp;90/100 (mean 83.7)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last two chosen<br />Assignments:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) 81.5/100 (mean 83.7)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) 100/100 (mean 81.3)<br />Class participation (No idea but probably high because I attended most classes)<br />Case study (No idea what happened to that)<br /><br />Ended up with an A but I don&#039;t know how so yeah",
