    "description": "Soft Robotics is an emerging field of research that focuses on the use of soft materials to realize adaptive behavior in robots. This course will provide an overview of the soft robotics field covering both technology and applications. Through a series of lectures and hands-on practice during labs, students will be brought up to speed with the latest technological developments in soft actuators, soft sensors, soft robot manufacturing, soft robot modelling, and soft robot control. For the final project, each student group will deepen their knowledge on a selected technology from a recent research paper. Taking inspiration from nature, the chosen technology will be deployed to realize a robotic manipulation or locomotion system with an application in medical care, health care, aerospace, agriculture, or search and rescue. Instructorâ€™s approval is required.",
