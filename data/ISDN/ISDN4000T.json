    "description": "This course highlights the significant role of colour in the design process and offers fundamental insights into design principles. As design embodies creative problem-solving, colour serves as a key element in both the design process and the resulting product. This course will introduce some basic theories for colour application meanwhile examine the concept of human-centric product design. By bridging the gaps between art, engineering, and social science, this course underscores how thoughtful design can significantly enhance the quality of human life. We will begin with the fundamentals: understanding the scientific colour basic circle and colour order system, for instance the NCS colour system and CIE colour system. Meanwhile, we will explore the psychological and cultural implications of colour, learning how different hues can evoke emotions and convey meaning. We’ll examine case studies from graphic design, interior design, architectural design, urban design, industrial design, and more, offering students a broad understanding of how colour theory is applied in real-world context. The second part of this course will be related to form design, it will go through a combination of theoretical discussions, practical exercises, and hands-on projects, students will develop a deep understanding of form and its role in design. The course will include both lectures (theories, history, cases analysis, etc.), field trips, guest lectures from industrial partners, and laboratory works (group work, guided hands-on design projects based on real issues, experiential learning, physical/digital prototyping, presentations). Students will experience experiential learning, cross-disciplinary teamwork, and student-centred learning. For Non-ISD students, you will get a good taste of ISD learning mode. Instructor’s approval is required for enrollment in the course.",
