    "description": "Design Research is an introduction of research methodology and methods used for exploring problems as well as identifying opportunities for design initiatives. It guides designers how to unravel needs and problems in the real world before inventing. This course introduces students various design research principles, methods and ethics for investigating people and their world. It is a learning-by-doing course in which students, work in groups, learn the principles in class and apply them in the field. The course sets out several challenges in local context. After conducting both contextual research and user research, students are guided to seek insights and identify opportunities for technological innovation aiming to solve the identified problems. Overall, students explore the real world in a lively yet methodical way.",

      "comment_content": "The content revolves around the design process journey. Majority of the discussions were spent discussing specifically research methods e.g. interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is very easy to grasp, so the pacing of the course could be improved to add more content.The discussion for prototyping was more rushed. The content for this course seems to be for a 1 or 2 credit course, not a 3-credit course.<br /><br />However, what it lacks in content is demanded from in the projects. Students are expected to make time outside of class (about at least two days&#039; worth of time) to conduct research and site visits to innovate the solution to the theme that the professor announced. These are not very difficult. You just have to follow what the professor mentioned to include during class and make sure your presentation is detailed. For instance, always have an answer for why a certain decision was made.<br /><br />I would suggest anyone who is not taking ISDN to not take this course. Choose other introductory courses instead to evaluate ISDN as a major. This offfers only a shallow introduction to ISDN.",
      "comment_teaching": "Although students do practices to emulate the design process mostly through Miro (creating mind maps), the professor is intent on a monologue style class, so it might be boring and difficult to stay attentive. There was an instance where a group was discussing their midterm project and the professor told them to leave if they were going to chit chat.<br /><br />If ever you get stuck on what to do for your project and how to continue, the professor is always ready to give advice and suggestions.",
      "comment_grading": "I heard from seniors that it is difficult to get an A due to high standards. I would say it depends on who you get as your groupmates. In my case, I think getting an A is very doable. You just have to have presentation skills and prepare well.<br /><br />Grade I got: A-<br /><br />When majority did not do that well on the midterm, the professor changed the grading percentage to help. He also gives suggestions after the midterm so that you will get higher on the final.",
      "comment_workload": "There is not much assignments or work to do until one to two weeks before the presentations where your entire group rushes to pick a date for site visits and research amongst other things. I would say this is easier to manage for direct entry ISDN Year 1 students without much exams but very difficult for other students in Year 2 or students who are taking ISDN 1002 to check out ISDN as a major.",

      "comment_content": "Going through the design thinking process, learn how to put ourselves in users&#039; shoes. It is inspiring as it is different than the usual problem-solving teaching content. The school-related real problem would be chosen to solve, it did not require you to give a financially feasible solution, yet it encouraged you to explore the possibilities of the solutions.",
      "comment_teaching": "Warm-up exercises given before really working on the project we chose are nice. However, some lectures are just listening to the theories could be tedious. TA and the instructor gave insightful comments when you are struggling with the project.",

To be frank I am satisfied with the grading, no worries on it, you will get what you deserved.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is not stressful, have some progress in each lesson, as teams were solving different problems, the pace would be different. Taking good control of that would be advised. Most groups did not complain about the workload as it is nothing when compared with the course they took on wed from 6-9 pm. (maybe that course allow us to have a glimpse of the workload of isdn programs)",

      "comment_content": "The course revolves around design, and teaches different research methods in design (Observations, interviews, design probes, user journey maps), all of which, in my opinion, were interesting, and more importantly, it has actual uses outside of the course as the same skills can be applied to doing projects in general, I found the material useful and interesting, but to some people they may find the course contents to be very vague.<br /><br />The content is not difficult to understand, and the work we needed to do was not difficult, but it was very time-consuming.<br /><br />The syllabus: <br /><br />Introduction Chapter 1: Conceptual understanding<br />Literature review<br /><br />Chapter 2: Developing empathy<br />Observation<br />Interview<br />Thoughtless acts<br /><br />Chapter 3: Yielding research insights<br />Three key insights<br />Translating insights<br /><br />Chapter 4: Seeking design opportunities<br />Three design concepts<br />An initial defined problem<br /><br />Chapter 5: Acting out possible ideas<br />Design probes Design probe findings and analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />User journey map<br /><br />Chapter 6: Problems redefined<br />A redefined problem&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A new user journey",
      "comment_teaching": "Teaching was very good, Luisa is very friendly and approachable, she creates a very comfortable learning experience in class, and lets the class discuss and ask questions. The lecture experience is very good.<br /><br />It is also very easy for us to email her if we have any problems, and she would always reply quickly with detailed explanations.<br /><br />She also gives feedback on your work every week, which is very helpful in performing well in the course as you get to understand where you could improve, and where you have done well. <br /><br />The TAs also give very good feedback, their insights on your work is also very helpful in doing your project. Overall I believe the teaching for this course is excellent.<br /><br />Attendance is required, but either way you should come to every class since the concepts in the PowerPoint may not be very clear.",
      "comment_grading": "The Design Research Report (individual work) 50%<br />This is the main part of the course, you are required to create a book, detailing your design research.<br /><br />Interim Design Research Critique (teamwork) 20%<br />A presentation of your major key research insights, design opportunities and the Design Brief.<br /><br />Final Design Research Critique (teamwork) 30%<br />A presentation of the redefined problem and your new user experience, supported by a series of cultural probes, user journey map and prototypes. <br /><br />As you can see, you are required to work in a team for the project, so there is always the chance of getting bad teammates, luckily my teammates were quite capable.<br /><br />The presentations are also less difficult than you may think as it is only a 5 minute presentation, and you have already done the content for the presentations prior to it. You only need to copy and paste what you already wrote, and repeat it in the presentation.<br /><br />Grading is not clear, you don&#039;t get to see your exact score, but from Luisa&#039;s feedback you can get a general sense of how you did from the language used.<br /><br />Overall, I received &quot;good&quot; for my presentations and a few &quot;well done&quot;s on my chapters, and got an A-, grading is OK, but the price I paid for it is a heavy one.",
      "comment_workload": "While most things about the course is great, the workload is very heavy. <br /><br />You are required to do something every WEEK, such as writing a report, interviewing people, designing and making your probe, giving the probe to people and receive their feedback, and more. You are also encouraged to use InDesign to create your project, instead of Word, which also meant you need to learn a new piece of software to make your project, which is also time-consuming.<br /><br />I had 6 courses this semester, and this one course easily took up 40% of my time, I need to put almost a full day of work into this course every week. However I would rate it as a C instead of D since the things you needed to do is not difficult, only time-consuming. The amount of work for a 3 credit course is just very heavy.<br /><br />Overall, despite the workload, I still enjoyed the course, so I recommend it.",
