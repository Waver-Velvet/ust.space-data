    "description": "This course will provide the theoretical principles and real-life examples of a wide variety of digital design technology. The course includes using computer-aided techniques to convert sketches into digital 3D models, animate static 3D models into computer animation, and finally render the 3D models to become the final product image or video. The course also describes how the 3D models and renderings are being used in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Topics covered will include Photogrammetry, Fundamentals of 3D Modeling, NURBS, Principles of Traditional Animation, Computer Animation, 3D Rendering, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Instructor’s approval is required for enrollment in the course.",

      "comment_teaching": "The lectures are really boring, and the content is not important for the lab and your project anyway, so most ppl just do their stuff during the lecture.<br /><br />However, compared with the lecture, the labs are quite intensive (due to the teaching style of the TA). The TA teaches things very quickly, it is normal that you can&#039;t catch up in the lab, just feel free to ask for help. Although the labs are intensive, it is interesting to learn new stuff and make models",
      "comment_grading": "The labs are not difficult to finish, just follow the ppt and rmb to ask ppl for help if you don&#039;t understand.<br />Quizzes are mainly focus on the theories of 3d modeling, plz read ppt before the quizzes<br /><br />For the project, it is important to do things earlier and avoid being a deadline fighter because rending really takes A LOT OF TIME. You can borrow computer if you need it (we have two rtx 4090 desktops, yay)<br />Many ppl hv complained about the storyboard part, actually, the instructor and TA didn&#039;t really teach us how to draw a storyboard (and it is their fault, no doubt)<br />Apparently, this is a big problem for our students! To solve this problem, you need to use your finger to click on Google search, type &quot;storyboard&quot;, then click the enter button, and click the &quot;photo&quot;, TADA! A bunch of examples of storyboards appear! And you can take them as references! What a life-changing skill! (Thanks me later!)",

I can guarantee you most content of this course can be learned in youtube, and the videos are much more better than the course.",
      "comment_teaching": "Saikit is the most boring instructor I ever meet in HKUST. 3D Design should be an interesting topic and Saikit is making it as boring as possible. He is teaching boring concepts during lectures, no body is listening. Students are writing assignments and play games and other things during lecture, and Saikit is ignoring everything.<br /><br />One thing to mention is that the UGTA actually has the best teaching skills in the course, I think the instructor should learn more from UGTA.",
      "comment_grading": "Labs 30%<br />Quiz 20%<br />Project 50%<br /><br />The project is a joke. Although this is a 3D design course, over 20% of the grade depends on your sketching skills. If you are not good at sketching but good at 3D design, better not to be self confident on this course, the sketching part will make you loss your passion and grade.<br /><br />One more funny things is that the instructor and TA Terrence never taught the students how to make a story board, and I belive themself don&#039;t know what is a storyboard, but they are keeping assign storyboard and judging student&#039;s work based on their opinion.<br /><br />At the end of the day, they make me lost the passion in design, and I transfered out of ISD. I will thank Saikit and Terence to help me make this decision, and I&#039;m feeling a lot better about my university life now.",

But prepared to work 500+ hours on the project if you want a better grade. There are students who are both hardworking and talented, since the grade is relative, you need to put more effort on the project.",

      "comment_content": "In two to three weeks, we leaned a software, they are thino, processing, blender and unity (if you do not know what are these softwares, google it). Every lab we would use the software we learned that week to implement some small functions. For example, in rhino lab we build our 3D print sports car, in processing we draw some simple graphs with java, in blender we add bones to a stick man figure, in unity we control the movement of the stick man. Besides these four softwares, we also have a lab to learn human body position recording. <br />PS: highly suggest programming skill to take this class, since processing require java and unity require C#.",
      "comment_teaching": "Two professors are very nice. They could help you out of class at any time. Before the final project, they could talk with your group about your proposal for many times, if needed. Every class, professors would prepare very detailed handout, that helps lot. they provided unlimited 3D print material and Alienware laptops and many VR glasses as lab materials. The only bad thing is that they prolong the class many times, but they have improved a lot this semester.",
      "comment_grading": "Our first three projects have very detailed grading explanation, which are graded by TAs. The professors also explain our projects in class anonymously. But the last two projects I didn’t see my score. The final projects is very important, as shown below 40%. I have to say that the grading is pretty fair, depending on how much efforts you have put into this project, not like ISDN 1000 professor.<br /><br />Labs 30% <br />Quiz 30% <br />Project 40%",
      "comment_workload": "We have no homework, just project and project and projects. Approximately every two weeks we would have a small project, about what software we have learned that week. It really takes a lot of time, cause if you want a good grade in projects which take a large percentage, you need to implement many details and two professor really look at your effort. We have one month to design and implement our final project. Our group stayed up for three nights to finish our game.",
