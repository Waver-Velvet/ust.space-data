    "description": "RoboMasters Robot Contest is a robot competition platform created for young engineers. Participating teams will get out of the classroom and independently develop and manufacture robots for the shooting confrontation. The contest will provide them with an opportunity to obtain precious practical skills and use strategic thinking, combine theories with practice and create advanced smart robots through fierce competition. Each year, new game field, rules of competition (https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/robo/rm) and a new technical challenge are introduced to the competition. Enrollment in the project course requires instructor's approval. May be graded PP.",

No instructor, no lab, no tutorial, no exam.<br />Literally everything about robots:<br />Mechanical (material, design, manufacture.......) btw, they got many CNC machines, crazy.<br />Electrical (PCB, chips, soldering......)<br />Embedded (C++, OOP, Control theory, human interaction.......)<br />Algorithm (Computer Vision, SLAM, lidar......) yeah they got 3 PRO LIDAR IN THEIR LAB!!!<br />Operation (Project management, Media, Finance, Outreach......)",
      "comment_teaching": "Self-taught, if you don&#039;t ask you will get nothing. Do more, ask more, and then you will learn more.",
      "comment_grading": "Team members tried their best to get as much A range as possible. There is around 50% - 60% A and around 30% B range. C, D and F were for the people who never showed up.<br />If you are interested and willing to put time and effort into it, you will definitely get a good grade. If you are an Engineering student, you will most likely get a Robotics Minor because this course will fulfill the requirements.<br />If you just want a Robotics Minor, RUN!!! You will be pushed regularly and you won&#039;t have any energy to finish anything. Both you and the other members won&#039;t have any good time.",
