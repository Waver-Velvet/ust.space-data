    "description": "This Project course gives HKUST undergraduate students the opportunity to work in teams from different schools, to serve identified community group (i.e. primary and secondary school students/South Asian youths etc.), to understand limitations on the served groups and to learn how to apply theoretical knowledge on the building of under-water robots. Throughout the project, HKUST undergraduate students will act as teachers by transferring their skills of under-water robot building to primary and secondary school students and/or South Asian youths. HKUST undergraduate students will also learn the skills of event management throughout the project. Students must obtain prior approval from course coordinator for enrolling in the course.
