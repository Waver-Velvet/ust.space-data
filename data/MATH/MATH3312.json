This course, to be honest, is not a MATH course at all, and I learnt nothing from this course. <br /><br />The reason why I take this course is because I want to learn the algorithm for me to type code and perform simulation, instead of me myself simulating what a computer will do. I want my computer to perform calculations for me, rather than me myself performing calculations as a computer.",

I admit that I did not go to the lecture, but that does not imply you can harass us for 20 minutes. Stop repeating &quot;This is not your usual linear algebra course. This is numerical analysis.&quot; during the exam. Also, we know computers use floating numbers so stop saying them during the exam. If you want to tell us, do so after exam. <br /><br />Oh let me tell you something: If your teaching is good, then you need not worry about your attendance. Just walk for a few steps. Look at Desmond in the same floor. Prolly take some time to go to his lecture. Just look at how he teaches, and look at how many people is in his classroom.

Fortunately, his lecture slides are self-explanatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#039;s better to self-study in my opinion. <br /><br />He replies to emails quickly so that&#039;s a plus.<br /><br />However, in the final, for one of the only two questions that involve analysis (Error bound theorem for Euler&#039;s method), he gave us the wrong solution formula and there was a lot of confusion. I screwed up that question and lost 6 marks. Because of this incident, I also couldn&#039;t finish another question on time and lost 4 marks there...

Let me put some summary on this course first:<br /><br />i. Many numerical iteration algorithms are covered in courses like MATH1024 (FF&#039;s version, for numerical integration) and MATH5285 (for many other algorithms), and these courses teach the related content using a few lectures.<br />ii. In overall, the course teaches algorithms for &quot;classical stuff&quot; like root-finding, numerical differentiation/integration, and solution to system of equation.<br /><br />========Part One: Contraction mapping theorem=======<br /><br />-&gt; Essentially the same as the first part of MATH5285 (Except advanced algorithm like Gauss-Seidel which are put in last part). If interested, please look at my review for MATH5285.<br /><br />=========Part Two: Lagrange polynomial===========<br /><br />-&gt; Theoretical basis: Weierstrauss approximation theorem (For any continuous function defined on compact interval, there is polynomial uniformly approximating the function)<br />-&gt; Construction of polynomial: Lagrange interpolation<br /><br />==========Part Three: Numerical differentiation===========<br /><br />-&gt; Algorithms are deduced by either Lagrange polynomial, or by Taylor series.<br />-&gt; Forward/backward difference (Lagrange poly. of order 1)<br />-&gt; Three-point method (Lagrange poly. of order 2)<br />-&gt; Three-point second derivative (Taylor series, order 4). This is essential because one step for deriving the Simpson&#039;s rule does require this. <br /><br />===========Part Three: Numerical integration===========<br /><br />-&gt; Trapezoidal rule (Lagrange polynomial, order 1)<br />-&gt; Simpson&#039;s rule (Taylor series, order 4)<br />-&gt; Midpoint rule (Taylor series, order 2)<br /><br />========Part Four: Solving ODE======<br /><br />-&gt; The only algorithm taught is the Euler&#039;s forward difference method. It is derived by Taylor series again. <br />-&gt; However, the derivation for error bound of this algorithm is relatively difficult in this course. Make sure you understand, say find the Lipschitz constant for Lipschitz continuous function.<br /><br />========Part Five: System of equation========<br /><br />-&gt; LU Decomposition (Factorize square matrix by a lower triangular and upper triangular matrix)<br />-&gt; Jacobi&#039;s method, Gauss-Seidel, SOR...",

The efficiency of grade release for homework is ridiculously slow. After final exam, I still don&#039;t know the grade for the last two homework.<br /><br />For final, make sure you know how to derive algorithms and their error bounds. If you are familiar with analysis, then spending one or two days for revision is fine. Speaking of final, this year&#039;s final is roughly similar to the past exam released on the internet, except that the advanced algorithms in last part are examined. The most absurd thing is that, many amendments are made during exam, but no extra time is added due to those annoying changes.",
