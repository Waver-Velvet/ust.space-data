    "name": "Independent Study: Martingale-based Program Analysis",
    "description": "In recent years, martingale theory has found surprising yet important applications in formal verification of probabilistic programs. This course will focus on this new development. It will first cover the background required from probability theory and martingales, and then focus on the various notions of ranking supermartingales that exist in the theoretical computer science literature. The courseâ€™s aim is to provide not only a holistic coverage of this emerging research field, but also to enable the student to contribute new results in the termination and cost analysis of probabilistic programs. Students should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course.",
