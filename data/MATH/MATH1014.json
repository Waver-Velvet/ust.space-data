      "comment_content": "One of the notable aspects of this math course was the slow pace of the lectures. While some students prefer a slower pace to fully grasp the concepts, it can be a disadvantage for those who have a solid foundation in mathematics or prefer a more accelerated learning experience. The slow pace may result in boredom or a feeling of time wasted for such students.<br /><br />Due to the slow lecture pace, many students found themselves seeking alternative learning resources to supplement their understanding of the course material. One popular recommendation was to watch YouTube clips on specific math topics. These clips provided concise explanations and demonstrations, which allowed students to learn at their own pace and review the material at their convenience. The availability of online resources like YouTube has undoubtedly revolutionized the way students approach their studies, offering a wide range of perspectives and teaching styles.",
      "comment_teaching": "Contrary to the popular belief that the tests in this math course were exceptionally challenging, I found them to be relatively manageable. The long questions, which often involved integrations, were straightforward if one had a solid grasp of the different integration techniques. Recognizing and applying the appropriate method to solve these questions was the key to success.",
      "comment_grading": "The tests in this math course were primarily concept-based rather than relying heavily on computational skills. This approach aimed to assess students&#039; understanding of the underlying principles and their ability to apply them to various problem-solving scenarios. While this format may be challenging for some students who prefer more straightforward calculations, it encourages a deeper comprehension of the subject matter.",
      "comment_workload": "The course heavily utilized webwork, an online platform for submitting math assignments and quizzes. While webwork can be challenging for some students, there was an abundance of online resources available to assist in completing the assignments successfully. These resources included websites, forums, and video tutorials that provided step-by-step explanations and examples for each problem type. The availability of such resources proved invaluable in helping students navigate through the webwork assignments and clarify any confusion they encountered.",

Some of the tutorial questions are much harder than the questions in mid-term and exam, so the Ex in the textbook is better.",

And the only way you can do that is to use the formula into harder problems, and see where your blindspot was. Don&#039;t get me wrong, she covered the easy problems well, but you have to do a lot of self-learning if you wanna prepare yourself for exams and get a good grade here because the course itself is inherently hard :( I hope this doesn&#039;t discourage you to take MATH1014<br /><br />if you decide to take her class anyway, please ask a lot of questions and seat infront ready for it!

You can&#039;t just say do textbook questions when your method of teaching is just this bad. He couldn&#039;t do some simple integration questions right in 30 minutes and then just say this question is a bit complicated and stopped doing it. I hate the lecture a lot. <br /><br /><br />The tutorials were excellent. TA LAU Hing Sang is the opposite of the instructor. he explained the concepts very clearly then he chose the questions that are very helpful for us to understand.

Pretty clear English, ample notes on the whiteboards and the pace was not hard to follow. He sometimes shared his thoughts on some math topics, and I think people who like maths would find his course informative.<br /><br />On the other hand, his lectures tended to be a bit theoretical, thus might not contain many things that directly related to questions in exams. Therefore, do search for more practice questions. Sure that his notes are handy, but do not limit yourself to the notes (personal experience, when looking back to my learning process, I think I did not practise enough, and that&#039;s fatal to a math course).<br /><br />Due to unknown reasons, our progress falled behind the tide, and we finished all materials after Taylor Polynomials in no more than two lectures.

He couldn&#039;t help but question his abilities and wonder why he had underestimated the course&#039;s difficulty. The online comments he had read about the course being challenging suddenly seemed valid, and he regretted not taking them more seriously.<br /><br />The boy knew he had to reflect on what went wrong and take action to improve. He realized that studying M2 alone was not enough to excel in MATH 1014. It was a wake-up call for him to reassess his study strategies, seek help from professors or tutors, and put in extra effort to catch up with the course material.<br /><br />Though disheartened by the low score, the boy understood that setbacks are a part of the learning process. He reminded himself that it was not the end of the world and that he could still turn things around. With renewed determination, he made a plan to dedicate more time and energy to understanding the concepts, practicing problems, and seeking assistance whenever needed.<br /><br />The boy&#039;s experience served as a valuable lesson in managing expectations and acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead.

He frequently utilizes the whiteboard, so make sure to sit towards the front of the class in order to see the words clearly. Attendance is not mandatory, as he uploads all material, including written notes, onto Canvas. Additionally, he enjoys going beyond the curriculum, delving into topics like hyperbolic functions. If you&#039;re interested in this kind of material, I would highly recommend taking his course.",

(To be honest, sometimes find his hand written notes in lectures to be more helpful than those notes he post on canvas)<br />Although providing the proof may help with understanding the theory, it also cause the paste of the lecture section to lack behind others. Resulting in the whole Taylor Series part (one of the rather difficult concepts) to be covered in like 1 lecture or so.<br />TA Henry Tsang is pretty good at explaining the concepts that needs to be focused on and is more helpful compare to some other TAs I would say.

However, I found that her lectures notes are very messy and hard to read because every page is full of words. <br /><br />Besides, I think I found some mistakes in her lecture notes so I sent email to ask all 3 TAs of L9 because Ye Guibo said she never answer email on Sunday and Saturday. Still no one reply my email after one week. What would you feel when you spend a lot of time on setting query and composing emails but the receiver ignore them. I don&#039;t really care whether they are strong or not but I care about their attitude. But I guess one male TA of L9 is decent and acceptible because he tried hard to answer my questions in tutorial class T9A. Although I might not fully understand some concepts, I still appreciate his efforts.<br /><br />Also, Ye Guibo&#039;s accent is bad. For example, in last few lectures I finally figure out that &quot;offer-we-are-say&quot; is &quot;obviously&quot;. So pay attention to it.<br /><br />Another thing is that she doesn&#039;t want to run the risk of being late on another class so she would only answer you very briefly if you ask her questions right after class in that situation.<br /><br />In tutorial class, most people just attend the first one to see whether the TA are good or not and whether attendance would be taken or not.

As long as you write something on it, you got 1 point. If you write some steps and try to finish some of the questions, you got the full mark. If you were absent or didn&#039;t submit, you got a 0.

      "comment_teaching": "Disclaimer: I am in a good mood today, this review is likely biased in TK&#039;s favor. (On a regular day, will give him F) <br /><br />Teaching Style:<br />TK likes to go into a lot of theory not useful for exam. He also enjoys making up questions on the spot that he cannot solve without making 2+ mistakes. Very hard to follow and connect theory/proofs to questions solved, especially as they are not similar to exam or homework style questions and he does not explain thought process before solving + always makes mistakes. <br />Often, he just explains and derives the origins of each formula/shortcut mathematically but allocates very little time to <br />how and when to use each formula. <br /><br />Time: <br />Spent too much time re-capping 1013/high school content that we were left with 3 lessons before finals for the final topic. TK decided to not test on final topic but notified everyone with 1 week before the exam. He also kept teaching the final topic and did not go over previous content at all (in SBM it is common for professors to have 1-2 revision lessons to refresh our minds before finals season)<br /><br />TK&#039;s unpreparedness in lessons meant that he did a lot of improv. He makes up questions on the spot and sometimes decides halfway through solving it that it is too tedious and changes the question - but doesn&#039;t demonstrate how to solve it! (He only gave a general/theoretical explanation). He also makes a lot of mistakes that students have to point out. Would hence recommend rewatching recordings instead of joining live. <br />To buy time for improv, he writes down everything he says on his iPad. Whereas TAs have prepared condensed, no BS version of curriculum and some even have handwritten scans of questions, solutions, diagrams etc (like PPT style teaching) and explain things more thoroughly. Highly recommend watching tutorials (fortunate for me, zoom Uni meant I had access to all TA tutorials in 2 lectures so I could choose the one that suited me most)",

      "comment_content": "Integration, series, polar<br />詳細請睇其他Po，因爲我主要黎分享1014既趣事<br /><br />另外附上TKL既email，將會成爲經典建議大家背下：<br />Dear Math1014 students,<br /><br />A number of email starting with “It is clear the overall midterm result of Math1014 ………” have reached my mailbox, but not as many as some students might have imagined; significantly less than 10 as far as I can remember. Given that about 150 students did not take the midterm exam, unlikely due to health problems, one could tell how confident some students were before the midterm day.<br /><br />I do not find it necessary to argue about the level of difficulty of the midterm, and from a distribution point of view the midterm turns out to be somewhat normal; a bell-shaped instead of an L-shaped distribution. To put it on record, the past Math1014 exams before the rise of the all mighty ZOOM were all closed book exams, without calculator too.<br /><br />Anyway, taking these unfortunate ZOOM days, or years, into account, I’ve unprecedentedly put a full solution of the midterm exam in the final exam information webpage. You probably should look at it and reflect on what went wrong with your own preparation for the midterm, especially if you fell apart in the midterm. Mumbling about how unfair the midterm was when compared with the past would not help a bit for passing the final. Still a few weeks of time to go before the end of the semester.<br /><br />We are not here to bury students with Calculus, and there is no problem for us to switch into a max of two assessment scheme to release some pressure on students:<br /><br />10%Homework + Max(35% midterm + 55% final,&nbsp;&nbsp;90% final)&nbsp;&nbsp;out of 100%<br /><br />However, if you want a decent grade, you would have to work for it.<br /><br />No assessment scheme can completely resolve the problems of those who are hit by anxiety. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help from the counselors in the Counseling and Wellness Center of HKUST if necessary.<br /><br />https://counsel.hkust.edu.hk/<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />-TK",
      "comment_teaching": "太多精彩野，咁我由頭開始講起<br /><br />第一件有趣既事發生係midterm果陣，我地既course coordinator TKL話如果中左肺炎就可以skip midterm只計final，但無中就鼓勵你去考，不過考衰左會照計埋你midterm :) 之後某討論區d人就水人唔好考midterm去送死，結果變左一班人無病都skip midterm<br /><br />同一時間，呀紫珊瑚講明midterm同final唔會考reduction formula<br />&quot;When I was a student (translation error), this (reduction formula) will not be included in the midterm or the final exam, because it is too complicated, I don&#039;t want you to spend 1 hour on doing this...&quot; (Jishan HU, 2022) 結果midterm出左reduction formula，fake 9曬，一堆人無溫到唔識，搞到個mean唔過4成 (以往absolute grading 無40%係fail)，即係半班fail左要summer重讀，就算比你final考得好都一定拉唔翻高分，爛硬grade。<br /><br />呢單野精彩到上埋連登，加上無考midterm班友係度笑9考左果班友，咁就引黎唔少人炸TKL email，要求兩個grading scheme (計or唔計midterm)。炎上到咁，TKL肯定比上頭照硬肺，照完超唔gurr，凌晨出左封email，語氣帶刺 &quot;We are not here to bury students with Calculus&quot; (TKL, 2022)<br /><br />第二單精彩野就係紫珊瑚擺烏龍。先講少少背景，人地好細個就讀PhD in Applied Mathematics，所以希望大家如佢所講，“Don&#039;t underestimate your instructor&#039;s IQ&quot; (Jishan HU, 2022)。拿拿拿，TKL封email講到明兩個grading scheme，跟住紫珊瑚話唔存在兩個scheme，得35%midterm 55%final果個，“Only Scheme 1 is used. I removed Scheme 2 since it is confusing. Scheme 2 was used for a reference only for the system.” (Jishan HU, 2022) 咁呀，d人之後拎住TKL封email對質，結果佢先跟翻兩個scheme，睇黎TKL真係有好好盡到coordinator既責任，竟然可以係出grade之前確保所有section用兩個grading system，好L感動。<br /><br />好啦好啦，終於出grade，小弟就total 90.1拎A-既，本來就覺得純粹爛grade就算啦，好死唔死比我發現其他section 89.2有A grade。我OS：呀胡生， 90.1&gt;89.2咁簡單既數唔洗學生教你呀嘛？你咁高IQ係咪先^^ 得得得，忍一時風平浪靜，我send封email問TKL發生咩事，佢話個excel檔未update我個分，係咪真係咁信下好啦，話唔定係咪每個section自己拉curve都唔知。TKL跟住就叫我揾紫珊瑚更正個grade，我email佢，佢就遲遲唔肯覆email。最好笑係我一forward埋比TKL，紫珊瑚幾分鐘内幫我update個grade。好啦更正翻個grade，大團圓結局了。<br /><br />係肺炎期間online上堂，竟然能夠比一個咁精彩，咁多花生食既course比我，TKL受少少氣都值得既，我代替班學生黎多謝你，仲有bye bye你條尾，係咁多~",

      "comment_teaching": "If the content is the more positive thing about this course, then the teaching, and administration, are utter trainwrecks.<br /><br />If we purely talk about the teaching of the course material, TK Lam actually did an OK job, despite frequent miscalculations. The most irritating thing is the attitude of the administration of this course.<br /><br />After the midterm (the arrangements of which you can read from the Grading section), students complained that the grading scheme unfairly favours those who skipped the midterm. TK Lam responded by emailing us the following:<br />1. Saying the midterm is not particularly difficult when compared to past years, and the distribution is bell curved;<br />2. &quot;Unprecedentedly&quot; putting the midterm solutions up (shouldn&#039;t this be your responsibility anyways? &quot;Instructors should.... Provide timely and constructive formative feedback to students on their performance as an important part of the student learning process.&quot; (Academic Registry, 2022)); <br />3. Blaming students for not working hard; and<br />4. Telling us to seek professional counseling.<br /><br />Apart from being unnecessarily rude and very condescending, it shows a total disregard of students who may be suffering due to insufficient MATH background. Students with C/D in 1012 might be forced to enrol in this course as it is a program requirement. Some other reviewers who quoted TKLam and wrote, &quot;There are no excuses apart from laziness.&quot; should consider that the world does not revolve around them, and everyone&#039;s circumstances are different.<br /><br />Another egregious example of administrative failure can be readily seen in the poor coordination between instructors. One instructor mentioned nearly verbatim the reduction formulae question in midterm. However, he immediately dismissed students&#039; concerns by saying &quot;this will not be examined in the midterm and final examination because it&#039;s too time consuming&quot;. The question appeared nearly exactly in the midterm. This highlights the failure in coordination and management of this course.<br /><br />The instructor of my tutorial, Phyllis, provided useful notes and exercises. Her teaching is the only positive thing I can say about the teaching of this course.",
      "comment_grading": "If you consider the mean of the examinations, most of the lecture sections will have mean C or D. Most famously, L2 (TK Lam&#039;s section) got a failing mean for the midterm.<br /><br />The grading scheme was originally as follows:<br />10% Homework, 35% Midterm, 55% Final<br /><br />Before the midterm, there were several threads on Goop (a social media platform targeted towards local higher ed students) about their unpreparedness for the midterm. Some anonymous people commented that they should skip the midterm if they are not prepared enough, as the midterm percentage will be automatically transferred to the final. <br /><br />After the midterm, &quot;around 150 students&quot; (TK Lam, 2022) are found to have skipped the (more difficult) midterm. As one lecturer who wishes to remain anonymous mentioned, skipping the midterm to get a better grade should never have been an option without medical proof. How is it fair that students are allowed to skip major course grading components freely without repercussions?<br /><br />After the midterm, the following appeared in the final webpage:<br />&quot;No makeup exam will be arranged for minor medical reason, even with a letter form a clinical doctor. Exceptions will only be made if you are hospitalized with proof.&quot;<br /><br />One can only note that TK Lam is a remarkably &quot;compassionate&quot; professor.<br /><br />The new grading scheme, after complaints detailed in &quot;Teaching&quot;, are as follows:<br />10% Homework + max(35% midterm and 55% final, and 90% final only)<br /><br />A final anecdote: The instructor who gave away the midterm question previously (in the &quot;Teaching&quot; section) removed the 2nd grading scheme because it was &quot;too complicated&quot;. Although this was swiftly remedied, it again highlights the incompetence in management and administration.",

      "comment_teaching": "After hosting a mt exam whose mean lower than 50, TKLAM wrote: (strongly recommend to recite all this cause it could be classic)<br />A number of email starting with “It is clear the overall midterm result of Math1014 ………” have reached my mailbox, but not as many as some students might have imagined; significantly less than 10 as far as I can remember. Given that about 150 students did not take the midterm exam, unlikely due to health problems, one could tell how confident some students were before the midterm day.<br /> <br />I do not find it necessary to argue about the level of difficulty of the midterm, and from a distribution point of view the midterm turns out to be somewhat normal; a bell-shaped instead of an L-shaped distribution. To put it on record, the past Math1014 exams before the rise of the all mighty ZOOM were all closed book exams, without calculator too.<br /> <br />Anyway, taking these unfortunate ZOOM days, or years, into account, I’ve unprecedentedly put a full solution of the midterm exam in the final exam information webpage. You probably should look at it and reflect on what went wrong with your own preparation for the midterm, especially if you fell apart in the midterm. Mumbling about how unfair the midterm was when compared with the past would not help a bit for passing the final. Still a few weeks of time to go before the end of the semester.<br /> <br />We are not here to bury students with Calculus, and there is no problem for us to switch into a max of two assessment scheme to release some pressure on students:<br /> <br />10%Homework + Max(35% midterm + 55% final,&nbsp;&nbsp;90% final)&nbsp;&nbsp;out of 100%<br /> <br />However, if you want a decent grade, you would have to work for it.<br /> <br />No assessment scheme can completely resolve the problems of those who are hit by anxiety. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help from the counselors in the Counseling and Wellness Center of HKUST if necessary.",

      "comment_content": "When a boy first entered the classroom of MATH 1014, he believed it would be a manageable course.<br /><br />&quot;I have studied M2,&quot; he thought. His heart persuaded him that online comments saying it is difficult were because they haven&#039;t taken M2.<br /><br />Days after days and mid-term exam passed,<br />One day when I was taking the bus, I saw the canvas notification, I knew, the date of judgment came. Click it, click it, wtf it kept loading,,,, loading....loading...and my heart was gradually falling... falling... and falling.<br />Suddenly, the screen turned red! The Canvas red! loading finish, and the score...<br /><br />38/100<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t believe it, was I a rubbish? oh sorry it was not a question. I was a rubbish. And it was my destiny to fail. Thank you UST, my dearest UST, it was you that gave me such a memorable experience that I would never forget. As a finance student, getting an F is equivalent to a failure, a loser... and my dream to pursue a Finance career is just like a joke...<br /><br />I need to work hard. I knew it, but given the 35% mid-term weighting, any attempt seemed to be useless. I cried, I desperated, I shouted, I laugh, I... Maybe... I was emotionally collapsed. <br /><br />I heard a lot of students were shouting or complaining at the forum, but I don&#039;t even have the motivation to shout. I tired...At a night around 2am, when I was once again despressed by what my destiny was. Suddenly, an email came...<br /><br />THE GRADING SYSTEM CHANGED！<br /><br />Mid term exam could be transferred to final! Suddenly, I smiled. I knew it was the God-given chance. I am not very bad at studying, and I knew it would be the only chance to prevent a F, which require 7 A+ if you still wish a dean list. <br /><br />At that time, although it was at night full of darkness, I could feel a slight ray of hope was shinning on the sky, and waiting me to catch it.<br /><br />I saw the Angel!<br /><br />At the remaining time, I worked hard to fight for my grade. I knew, I really knew, that god won&#039;t give me a third chance. So the 90%-weighted final would be my only hope.<br /><br />...<br />...<br />...<br /><br />The exam ended, and I knew all the things gone, the toughness, the struggling, the effort... would be all become such a tiny little number, that would decide my whole destiny. <br /><br />To be or not to be, that is a question. <br />To pass or not to pass, that decides my destiny.<br /><br />At the end of the end, after clicking multiple times of canvas, my final score comes:<br /><br />...<br /><br />96/100<br /><br />Suddenly, I was speechless. My voice was scrambling, and my eyes were staring at the screen.<br /><br />Thank you MATH 1014 - you demonstrate a journey of life. From a talented M2 student to a fail student, and from a fail student to become a normal student again. <br /><br />It is a simulation of a game of life <br /><br />Where there is a will, there is a way...",

But the course is so forgiving and I can&#039;t imagine how people get any grade below A. Seriously? :D<br /><br />p.s. GaoKao is much more difficult, I wish i had DSE instead.<br /><br />In this semester, there are a lot of students who complain about the difficulty of the mid term exam (30/100 is the mean). Well actually, in my humble opinion, it is because they don&#039;t have a sound mathematical foundation plus they don&#039;t study nor complete exercises. To be honest they totally deserved it as I think the difficulty is fair compared to GaoKao in mainland.<br /><br />This is not only my opinion, TKL also said the students did not work hard in the mid term.",

I learnt A-Level Single-Mathematics and its basically an extension of the AL syllabus. However when you get to the 2nd half of the course (aka after mid-term), you better get your stuff together because polars and series are absolute HELL.<br /><br />I suggest you to buy the book Calculus by J.Steward before the semester starts. You should learn in advance cause this is a very fast paced course. Literally no time to digest the contents whatsoever.",

Forget about scoring top marks in exam. <br /><br />however, if you really do want better grades (B or B+ above), make sure to do LOADS of practice. in the book Calculus by J.Steward, you get plenty of practice questions. Try to revise every day or at least every week. Too much to understand. <br /><br />I swear if i dont have that study break before final , I shall see you all next semester.",

I mean the kid that goes to math competitions, genuinely loves math and can spend all day thinking about math. That is what&#039;s required to get an A in this course in my opinion. <br /><br />I always thought math was one of my strongest subjects until I took this course. I did a Math EE for IB and was able to consistently score 6&#039;s and 7&#039;s in HL AA Mathematics. <br /><br />Despite being the course that I studied for 3x more than my other courses, it ended up being my worst grade. (B-). Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s not impossible to get an A, it&#039;s just very very very very very very very difficult.<br /><br />The tutorial guy is very nice though which is a plus.<br />Format is Calc II material.",
      "comment_teaching": "CHIANG, Edmund is truly an interesting teacher. If you enjoy math you will genuinely enjoy this course. However, if you simply want to get a good grade, I wish you luck. <br /><br />His teaching takes a pure approach to the theories being taught in class. It is very methodical and well thought out. Except for the fact that you can&#039;t understand half of what he is saying if you do not have a strong background in proofs. Furthermore, his lectures sometimes deviate from the course material purely for his own interest. He claims &quot;you guys must know about this, this is the most interesting modern approach to mathematics there is&quot;. Only to say at the end of the lecture that it isn&#039;t required for the course.<br /><br />So anyways, I hate this professor honestly, it&#039;s simply not the way I wish to be taught Math. I skipped all lectures after he began deviating from the course material (lecture 9?) and just learned from the organic chemistry tutor on YT.",
      "comment_grading": "Weighting:<br />25% midterm, 15% HW, 60% Finals <br /> <br />HW is easy because you have infinite attempts so not getting 100% on the HW will put you behind. <br /><br />Mid-term is maybe 100% easier than the final, because the test is open-book you simply need to print out the lecture notes and it&#039;s 25% of the test for free probably?&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#039;s still difficult though.<br /><br />Final is also open book, but it won&#039;t help. Because our dear professor loves the pure side of Calc II so much that he decided to change the format of the final test. I completed all the previous past papers of MATH1014 and was able to score 80% timed. On the actual final I got 44%. Why? Because the questions being asked were not similar at all to all 3 past papers. Completely a different approach to testing students. Which in my opinion, is stupid because you should be rewarded for studying past papers? no? Maybe it&#039;s just an IB thing. <br /><br />Anyways in my opinion if you get CHIANG, Edmund, you should attend every lecture and genuinely try to keep up with what he&#039;s saying, that&#039;s the best bet at getting a good grade in this course. <br /><br />Except for the lectures where he teaches things that are irrelevant to the course, which you won&#039;t know until he tells you at the end of the lecture so... yeah. <br /><br />ALSO:<br />Grading is absolute I&#039;ve heard, so standard deviation whatever doesn&#039;t matter. <br /><br />HW:<br />Mean = 75.38%<br /><br />Mid-term<br />Mean = 48.6%<br /><br />Final<br />Mean = 37.63%<br /><br />Total:<br />Mean = 47.3%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SD=18.4%<br />Me: 57% = B- <br /><br />Here is exactly how the grading works:<br />1.) they determine the mean after all exams are done<br />2.) they make the mean a high C+<br />3.) everything else is relatively graded based off this mean. +0.5 sd is B-, +1.0 sd is B-B+, +2SD is A range? I wouldn&#039;t know.",
      "comment_workload": "12 HW, requiring maybe ~2.5 Hours per HW to complete, maybe less. It depends if you need to learn the content the HW requires or if you already know it, also it starts easy and gets much harder once they begin teaching sequences, infinite series, conversion, and a bunch of tests to see where series converge/diverge.<br /><br />moderate - intensive.

However, during the last half, the topics became harder and the concept is not explained as clearly as before. Maybe since more and more people disappear and it is discouraging for the professor. After the midterm exam, most of what the professor explains in the lecture is not clear and helpful as before. <br /><br />The professor also make a lot of mistakes in his lecture notes so don&#039;t rely too much on it, although he will later correct his mistakes later onward",

Some content is hard to grasp if you don&#039;t have great mathematical intuition. I would recommend studying up on polar curves and the epsilon-delta and epsilon-N definition of a limit.",
      "comment_teaching": "The professor is clearly extremely passionate about mathematics and teaching. This is especially evident when he throws in some maths trivia/history in the teaching, and also tries to show us the deeper meaning of some things.<br /><br />However, he often fails to explain concepts clearly to begin with, and they only make sense if you have some surface-level understanding of the concepts. His explanations are also quite quick, so you have to pay close attention. He also makes lots of mistakes, which people often point out.<br /><br /><br />This professor is clearly passionate though, as mentioned earlier. After one lecture, I asked him a question about the complex form of the trigonometric functions and whether I could use those to my advantage in exams. After answering my question, he took me outside for a 30 minute one-to-one lecture on the history of maths and mathematicians/physicists/philosphers like Newton and Ramanujan and their contributions. It was interesting but certainly uncalled for.<br /><br />The TA (Tommy) is very good according to my classmates.

There were questions on my final that I would suspect most people cannot do. It is especially difficult for people who try and follow a rigid formula for working out similar categories of questions. For some questions, you need to be more flexible.<br /><br />There was also one 3 mark question which was completely out of syllabus and could only be solved by referring to a very specific proof in the lecture notes. Oh, and I shouldn&#039;t forget to mention that proof had many bugs.

      "comment_teaching": "Personally, I think professor Ye is great. <br /><br />She offers blank lecture notes and full lecture notes. The blank one is really helpful if you study the contents before the class and even reviewing them after class.<br /><br />Also, she gives students time to solve some example problems during the lectures. Further, she asks some important questions for students which is helpful for understanding the math concepts in this course.<br /><br />Among many professors who teach this course, I would definitely recommend others to listen to professor Ye&#039;s lecture.",
      "comment_grading": "-ClassViva homework (25%)-<br /><br />Unlimited attempts, make sure to get full marks.<br />The calculations can be a little messy compare to proper exam questions.<br /><br />The questions are not that hard but if you don&#039;t know how to solve certain questions don&#039;t hesitate to google them.<br /><br />-Final exam (75%)-<br />Consisted of three parts, 45min each<br /><br />Overall, it was not that hard but some questions related to the series(application of Taylor &amp; Maclaurin series) were a bit hard. If someone sees this, make sure to input more effort on that topic.<br /><br />Usually, the hardest part in Cal2 might be the work problems. However, this semester, there were no hard problems related to work. It was way too easy. Somewhat disappointing frankly. <br /><br />The grading seems to be similar to absolute and it might be because there&#039;s no statement that this course is graded by the curve in the syllabus.<br /><br />So overall 85%+ you&#039;ll get an A range<br /><br />ClassViva H.W.

He provides the textbook which is pretty good in giving formulas and proofs.<br /><br />Bad observations: lack of electronic adaptation, like iPad.

Just to make sure you reserve enough time to do before deadline, especially for hw 9 because I attempted 56 times. If you are a deadline fighter, you will fuck up in the hw part. Therefore, reserve at least one week for the hw to make sure you get all the 25% hw mark. <br /><br />Online calculators such as Wolfram Alpha and Symbolab are strongly recommended to use in both hw and final.",

Everything after mid-term, you basically have to self-study from Youtube as teaching is so bad. <br /><br />Before mid-term, it is not very hard to follow, but after mid-term, you are fucked. Trust me, i thought i was exceptionally good at Math until studying this course. I never had problem with math in my life but this made me hate mathematics<br /><br />Alot of questions on series and sequence on finals. Finals is alottttttt (i am emphasising ) harder than HW. I did spend alot of time revising stuff after mid-term, but some of them i still do not understand. <br /><br />Yeah, I know before i enroll to this course, i read reviews other ppl made on MATH 1014, i also thought i would do well if i spend enough time on this course and study on schedule, but as soon as i took my mid-term, i knew i was fucked. There were reasons why they write shit comments on this course. Uni is totally different. Acing this on top of other courses is simply impossible,&nbsp;&nbsp;unless you learn topics&nbsp;&nbsp;beforehand.",

      "comment_grading": "All MCQ, and since its online, he made the questions to be ridiculously difficult. It does not test you how you compute the numbers ( in other words, it does not test you which equation to use and what number to plug into calculator), but it tests you how much you understand the concept. So it is totally different from high school exams. In other words, you are fucked. <br /><br />Mean overall was around 50% ish OR less<br /><br />HW, you should get 100% because you can re-do until you get the correct answer. <br /><br />Overall, i got higher than the mean, but only received C+.<br />idk if it is absolute grading.",

HW every week and this takes quite alot of time considering you have stuff to do from other courses as well. <br /><br />Each HW has around 15~25 questions.<br />Well, HW is actually waste of time really because the type of questions you get on Finals is totally different from HW. <br />HW is all about computation, which is easy<br /><br />If you find this course really hard, i suggest you give up some topics in MATH 1014 and study more on other course. This is the strategy i used and i aced the other courses.",

She has accent (acceptable) and the lesson is quite boring, I think maybe because she is a new teacher and not familiar with the online teaching so that there are some technical problems, and she was just repeating the PowerPoint instead of writing something to explain better. But she is very kind and helpful teacher, any questions you ask she will answer you, no matter in the class or through email (so that takes lots of time). Also, she willing to open another session (when I join in there are only 1 student) to run pre-final to help students to prepare well (the official session is 11am and I had lesson) which other sections don’t have. So I think she has the passion to help students study.",

However, there is no midterm this semester and we have only one final exam. But the final exam is designed in a very bad way: 20 multiple choices and 2 hours time. Fairly speaking, if you do your daily works well, it&#039;s easy for you to get 90+ or even 100. As I know lots of students get 100.

Even though he does speak with a lot of fillers, his English is at least much more understandable than other Mainland professors. As a matter of fact, he does provide lecture notes. After each lecture, he would organise his notes and upload both his written and digital notes on Canvas. Some may say that he includes too many out-of-syllabus proofs in his teaching, but in my opinion, this helps me understand the content better. Therefore, I don&#039;t know why many would think Avery is a bad teacher. It is possible that he simply had changed though.<br /><br />On the other hand, Phyllis is an excellent tutor as always. I skipped my original tutorials and went to hers in the last semester, and I am very glad that she has become my actual tutor this semester. Her notes are useful, and she explains the concepts clearly. Technically, just attending the tutorials is more than enough for this course.",

Beware of the submission time as it was quite tricky to be stated like 4:50 a.m.. <br /><br />For my revision, I printed out Ke’s notes as I couldn’t just skim and scan the notes without practicing questions.

      "title": "Hopefully applications more than theoretical &amp; thinks like mathematicians",
      "comment_content": "A continual of MATH 1013 and the Calculus Course Series for all Engineering, Mathematics, RMBI and some Science/ Business students. Focus more on applications of calculus than pure theories and theorems that only mathematicians are likely to enjoy playing with them and have such a &quot;pure&quot; mindset. <br /><br />Topics include <br />Applications of integration (Area b/ curves, Volumes using Shell/Disk/Washer/Slicing Method, arc lengths, area of surface of revolution, avg. value of function, Work)<br /><br />Integration Techniques (By Parts, Trigo Integral, Trigo Sub.,Partial Fractions, Numerical Integrations using 3 rules, Improper Integrals) <br /><br />Polar Coordinates and Calculus (transformation, curves plotting, arc length, slope and area)<br /><br />Sequences and Series (Limit Theorem, Whole Bunch of Tests, Power Series,Taylor Series and Maclaurin Series)<br /><br />Vectors(Dot/Cross Product with mixed triple product)<br /><br />The course focus more on applications of calculus rather than rigorous mathematical proofs and playing with pure mathematics. <br /><br />The topics are in great variety and some of the topics are not actually useful for students with different intended majors and backgrounds. The whole course I think only the integrations are necessary for all students, the vectors are just for Civil/Mech/Sci students, Series mostly for EE/CE/Sci students.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching styles vary between instructors. <br /><br />For LI Jun, she performed below standard. Her class is like direct copying all the stuffs from the textbook and read aloud repeatedly without further explanations, implications and conclusions.The examples shown in class are usually way too easy to understand and it&#039;s just not the exam level examples. She focus a lot on sub-topics that are actually not the key point of the chapters. And her accent,typical Mainland accent and sometimes unable to pronounce words correctly.<br /><br />For TK Lam, he did a better job, just better but not the best. At least he is familiar with the topics covered in this course because he is in charge of the course for decades. However, sometimes he may cover examples which are not commonly found in the textbook and some topics are actually quite difficult to understand by just read the textbook. He addressed those parts with limited examples and not explaining in a very clear manner.Furthermore, he covers the topics in a fast manner and rush for completing all the content due to limited lecture time. And his writing... I think most of you know he writes in a messy and unorganized manner, sometimes he did mistakes and spent a lot of time searching the root of mistakes due to his terrible writing. <br />He is not that god-like but still just fine. <br /><br />For Phyllis, the specialized IA of TK Lam, did a much better job. Her tutorial notes and exercises are useful and help students to organize and consolidate the course content well. The tutorial notes and answers are uploaded on her web-page, so everyone can directly download and finish them even if you are not in her tutorial session.",

Always have bugs and errors for the server. <br /><br />Need to work very hard to clarify the concepts and work on the mysterious questions that are not explicitly shown in the textbook and exercises. Sometimes you still need to build your &quot;6th sense&quot; for some questions and better figure out what sort of techniques, tricks and possibilities that are being used in different questions.",

Basically, if you are not confident with the content in this course, you can attend the tutorial session or do more exercise and practice more.<br />Avery&#039;s style of teaching is not suitable for me, there is no powerpoint during the lecture, just hand-copied notes from Avery. He will post it to the course page a few hours after the lecture. Therefore, it is optional whether you are going to copy the notes during lecture or not.<br />My tutor is Mr. Ho Ming Leung, his tutorial notes are nice and will give each theory an example question and full solution. There is additional exercise at the last page of the notes. However, I don&#039;t really know why the answer to additional exercise is not provided.",

However, you must get at least 40% of the course grade to get a pass in this course.<br />The mean for MT and Final is around 40% of the total mark because the performance of midterm is really poor so that Avery introduced another grading scheme which allowed students to omit their mid-term score. However, I think the final exam is more difficult than midterm so better work hard and try to score a higher mark in the midterm exam.",

      "comment_content": "Although this course is designated as the subsequent course of MATH 1013, the focus of this course is more on computations and less on proofs. Even though there are some proof questions appear in the exam, you just need to memorise all the methods mechanically, unlike in MATH 1013 where some proofs requires your Math maturity. Moreover some skills in this course, such as definite integral and its application, Taylor&#039;s expansion, series and its convergence e.t.c., are actually very useful in further studies. So I recommend people who are from science and engineering school, regardless of their future major, should work harder in learning the materials.<br /><br />One side note is that concept of vector is introduced at the end, which I believe people who studied M2 in high school should be rather familiar with. However for other students, such as those who studied M1 in high school, this would be a chance to learn vectors as a prerequisite of more advanced math courses, such as linear algebra.",
      "comment_teaching": "Many has already commented Dr. Ho&#039;s teaching so I am not going to repeat. It is worth notice though that if you wish to choose Mathematics as your major (especially those who wish to choose pure maths track, though I would expect you be studying MATH 1024) , you might also want to sit other Professor&#039;s lecture or learn from additional reference book because his teaching many focus on computations and the transition from theory to application, which is not that helpful in developing math maturity and learning develop different concepts rigorously.<br /><br />Einstein Kong is also a very helpful TA and he is also good at explaining abstract concepts. So do try to sit his tutorial (if there is).",
      "comment_grading": "In this semester, the Professors claimed that absolute grading scheme is used though I suspect grading curve is also employed. I am not in a very justified position to comment this so I shall refer to other comments for this section.",
      "comment_workload": "It really depends on your previous knowledge on calculus and your math maturity. M2 really helps reduce a lot of workload. However even if you haven&#039;t studied M2 before, you can theoretically avoid some workload as the assignments (WebWork) are rather trivial that you can find answers on the internet. Though this will probably cost your grade if you don&#039;t really understand how to solve the assignments. Bonus quizzes are useful in increasing sub grades or even avoiding failing this course so it is worth to try. You can refer to sample quiz and the actual quiz is about the same with number differences.",

If you are careful enough in the final exam, you are able to get a high score.<br />Bonus quizzes: difficulty and format similar to webwork.

But this is university not secondary school more. Don&#039;t expect professor will teach you like a high school teacher! I try to understand better by reading textbook and Ho Hon Ming notes. Quite helpful :)",

I recommend to just skip the lectures and attend the tutorials, they are way more helpful.<br /><br />DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM.<br /><br />Shixin Liang<br />REALLYREALLY good TA, explains concepts succinctly and gives lots of good examples.

Once you slack, it gets super difficult to catch up and the exam week becomes a nightmare. You need to put a decent amount of effort in solving past papers and tutorial notes because the sums in the exams are similar but a lot more challenging. If conceptual understanding is not attained, forget even about a B. <br /><br />NOTE: IF ANYONE NEEDS CLEAR SOLUTIONS TO MOST OF THE TUTORIAL NOTES SUMS, FEEL FREE TO HIT ME UP!",
      "comment_teaching": "Avery&#039;s lectures were basically lessons on how a simple formula or relationship was derived which is completely useless when it comes to doing well in exams. He will direct questions to the students and end up answering them himself almost immediately lol. He has a very thick accent which gets a few weeks at least to get accustomed to and by the time you do, you realize half of the semester has gone by and you have better things to do than decipher the lecturer&#039;s accent and that&#039;s when you start running to the MSC, desperate for help that you don&#039;t even seem to know where. <br /><br />On the other hand, Phyllis is an excellent TA. The way she will explain concepts to you are exemplary. She will ingrain them in your mind and make sure you understand fully before moving on. However, she has a slight accent problem but it is way easier to comprehend than Avery&#039;s. <br /><br />All in all, I&#039;d recommend skipping the lectures but following the tutorials religiously.",

      "comment_teaching": "Li Zhen is a new professor, teaching for his first time.<br /><br />- Merit: Passionate and actively listening. His lecture style is just to use the whiteboard for everything, very wonderful as we can follow how he thinks. His presentation skills in terms of delivering the content is spectacular, everything just links together as lecture approaches the end: you can see him trying to show a theorem many times with various examples as if until you are convinced. Feel free to keep him after lecture for questions and you would see him solving them with you. (Handwritten notes available later online)<br /><br />- Weakness: His English accent is not particularly good but understandable. His pace of going through concepts and examples in a lecture can be quick and even accelerating, but it is equally satisfying if you manage to follow such a pace; there is often a 5 minute break in the middle :)<br /><br /><br />Zeta Chan, our tutorial TA, is very practical in solving questions. More like exam-oriented style problem-solving, which is interesting because Prof. Li put it theoretically and you may yet see how you can apply things. A big thumbs-up for his tutorial question set: he stapled and prepared a collection of all-topic questions across the whole semester, just bring that over every time and go to the question he is doing now (answers in a file was released online later). Questions are also highly welcomed; he would walk to you to confirm if you did it right, either by asking or looking at your writing. His English carries the Hong Kong-er accent but you can tell despite this he lays out things intuitively.<br /><br /><br />TA support in the Math Support Center is sufficient but usually poorly delivered. I don&#039;t feel welcomed, but rather kind of a trouble asking obvious questions. Maybe the TAs are already annoyed with meticulous queries of simple questions, and they are systematic enough to put up solutions onto the whiteboard just letting us to refer to it. But regardless of how much we learnt, this is not a learning environment that encourages trying, at least to me.",

Tutorial exercises are recommended as revision materials before final, because merely understanding would not be enough. You can even get tutorial exercises from other tutorial sessions, for example I used: Einstein&#039;s https://sites.google.com/site/einsteinkongstutorialwebsite/<br /><br />(Quiz: in this semester we have the quizzes starting from Easter break. 4 quizzes split into two periods to take, two quizzes available each period.<br />There were sample questions available for you to exercise with for as much time as you wish, and frankly the format is again very similar to the real quizzes.<br />Recommended to take them all early because as the deadline approaches the Math Support Center would be full-house but you must take the quiz with the computers there not yours; the quiz also has a time limit of 15-25 mins, so taking it with fewer people around shall relieve stress if any)<br /><br />For math lovers or curious people: I made notes solely on equations/concepts on my own and did the in-lecture/tutorial examples together with the lecturer/TA. So in my humble opinion, paying more attention during lecture and tutorial plus some little reinforcements at times would save much time. It is both more rewarding and efficient.",

From the light and kinky stuff like volumes of revolution to the hardcore and masochistic stuff like series expansions and partial fractions expansions. <br /><br />Okay, in all seriousness, it&#039;s Calculus 2 for those who follow the US curriculum. You learn integration techniques for the first half then you go on to learning series, sequences etc in the second half. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s useful stuff, but still hard none the less.",

To uhhhh integrate........&quot; When I heard that on the first class, I knew that I was in for a very bad time.<br /><br />Basically non-existent teaching. Instructor blitz through the content like there&#039;s no tomorrow. If you go to class, you can only hope to learn something through osmosis, because you&#039;ll be furiously taking notes that you&#039;ll never read/won&#039;t understand or you&#039;ll give up half way and just start playing with your phone or flirting with the girl next to you. Which you can then flex your intelligence and show her how much you&#039;ve self learned. <br /><br />To rub salt into the wound, you get NDS students who seem to understand everything to the point where they can even correct the instructor&#039;s careless mistakes. fml.

However, the webwork gives you unlimited tries so you can slowly guess your way through each assesment which takes only about 1.5-2 hours each on average.

He will repeat the important point once. The notes written in the lecture actually come from the the notes you got, but you should still attend his lecture, you will understand it better. At the end of each lectures, he will ask all students whether they have questions, I have never seen that there was students raising questions at that moment. However, if you really have questions, you can and you should ask him after the lectures. He is willing to answer you. You will feel his solemn attitude in the lecture and I also noticed his smile once only in the lecture (same as one of the previous reviewer). However, you will notice his sincere smile more if you ask him questions sincerely. <br /><br />Two reminders :<br />You need to attend his lectures to get the lecture notes.

You must pay more efforts to it as a student who has studied M2 may not even be able to handle this course easily.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t study anything about Physics in secondary school, make sure you&#039;ve understood and prepared for the questions about Works under the Integration topic. It is quite likely to appear in Mid-term and Final exams.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve studied M2 in secondary school, Congratulations! <br />You have relatively less workload than others, but you&#039;ve to pay extra attention to Convergence tests for Series as many students failed to understand and apply in the exam questions.
