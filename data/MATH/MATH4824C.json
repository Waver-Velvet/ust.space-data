    "description": "This course is concerned with the statistical theory and methodology of casual inference with applications in precision medicine. Tentative topics include: potential outcomes, average treatment effects, randomized experiments, covariate adjustment, regression discontinuity designs, observational studies, confounders, sensitivity analysis, propensity scores, matching, doubly robust estimators, difference-in-difference, instrumental variables, heterogeneous treatment effects and optimal treatment regimes. Students without course prerequisite need to seek approval from the course instructor to take this course.",

Tentative topics include:<br />potential outcomes, average treatment effects, randomized experiments, covariate adjustment, regression discontinuity designs, observational studies, confounders, sensitivity analysis, propensity scores, matching, doubly robust estimators, difference-in-difference, instrumental variables, heterogeneous treatment effects and optimal treatment regimes.<br /><br />You can see all of the contents are important in causal inference. Since causal inference is a subject one must learn if he or she wants to conduct empirical research in social science (economics, business, public policyâ€¦), I suggest that if you want to pursue a PhD in social science or want to do some research, take this course if you have a chance.",
