      "comment_content": "A good and satisfying course, for those potential math major students. <br />Covering:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sequences (chapter one）<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functions&nbsp;&nbsp;(chapter two)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differentiations (chapter three)<br />Each chapter provides relevant propositions/rules and their proofs. As expected, we learn some fundamental knowledge about these stuffs, and how to use them to deal with math problem. Especially, seems that the understanding of different axioms/rules/propositions and their relationships is the core of this course, for instance, you need to learn how Lagrange Remainder theorem is proved---its proofs bases on several propositions proved in previous lectures, with each of them pointing to some earlier propositions(sounds like a recursion tree). Anyway, it aim is building the foundation for you upcoming math studys, so what you can expect is something fundamental, which is usually related to proof-based problems.",
      "comment_teaching": "Actually, I think it might not be appropriate for me to make any comments on professor Fong&#039;s teaching, since most of the content I&#039;ve learned is self-taught. However, there is one thing I can say: his lecture note helps me a lot. Organized beautifully with interesting problems followed behind each chapter, it absolutely worth reading through. As for lectures, I think he mainly focuses on propositions and its proofs. Seldom(?) does he talk about any problems provided in HW or lecture notes, but I suppose there is no need to---solutions are provided by students&nbsp;&nbsp;in &quot;discussions&quot; in Canvas. But beware---these solutions are not always correct, so read it carefully.<br /><br />By the way, I LOVE LIU WENWEI. His tutorial lessons is AWSOME!!!",
      "comment_grading": "Though called abslotely grading, he sets the grade cuts based on score distribution. It makes a curve, eventually.<br />Grade book shows that one-thirds students falls in the A-range.<br />A medium grade gives you B+.<br />Lower quartile this time gives you B-.<br />3 students fails.<br />I don&#039;t know whether can that be called a good grade course, but that is the typical grade distribution of a honor class.<br />The best conclusion I can derive is that if you spend tons of time on this 3-credit course than you probably won&#039;t get a grade lower than B+.",
      "comment_workload": "Hard to say. It depends.<br />Someone can derive a multivariable function where the input is taget grade and intellegent, with workload as the output. As for me, I spend a lot of time---maybe more than half of my total study time---for this math course, and received a A+ eventually. For homework, it depends on your teammates. I have two nice teammates, so we three share the work load of HW and it didn&#039;t use us a lot of time(2-4 hours each week probably). But to truely master the content it requires a lot of practice and thinking, which is extremely time consuming. Doing pastpapers and read through kenneth ross&#039;s book(elementary analysis) helps, while they also take tons of time. So get prepared for a tough journey.",

      "comment_content": "Very nice content. <br />Professor Fong has exceptionally good lecture notes, which have a natural flow, making the content easy to understand. Lecture notes also include very good exercises, which I strongly recommend doing. I wish all the honors math courses had similar notes (and unfortunately, they don&#039;t).<br /><br />Each assignment, called a problem set, contains around five nice problems, which are very similar to exercises in the lecture notes. There were 10 assignments.<br /><br />Exams, however, are much more difficult than exercises in the lecture notes, so it is recommended to solve problems from past papers of prof. Fong and prof. Ivan Ip, which are approximately the same difficulty as the exam.<br /><br />Overall, the course is very well-crafted to both provide you with a good amount of knowledge and improve your problem-solving skills. My friends, who did not do many proofs in high school said that the course significantly enhanced their proof skills.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching was really good. The pace of the lectures was just right to follow the ideas, and you had time to think of proofs yourself. During the lectures, Professor Fong jokes very often, which creates a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere in the class.<br />Math 1023 with prof. Fong was definitely the most well-taught class I had this semester.",

      "comment_workload": "For me, the workload was light, as I did lots of proofs and gained a lot of math maturity back in high school. The whole workload for the week was around 5 hours, which involved around 1.5 hours of reading lecture notes and 2.5-4 hours of solving and writing up problems. <br />Despite that, my classmates who did not have that much exposure to rigorous proofs had to spend around 8 hours a week on the course.",

Also, it covers some concepts like density of rational numbers, achimedean property...... which are helpful in analysis.

The concept of supremum and infimum is tested in both exams, luckily the techniques are taught by FF thoroughly in class. I think I learnt a lot of bonus things from this course too, such as the way to reindex&nbsp;&nbsp;and reorder a double sum--I was always scared to deal with those. I&#039;m sure there are other extra things I learnt along the way, but it&#039;s hard to come up with it on the spot. Anyway, this course is a good place to develop your mathematical rigor. I&#039;m not sure if this will be useful in physics, but I think this course is fun so whatever.",
      "comment_teaching": "FF went through every step extremely thoroughly, barely skipping any steps in computation problems in lecture. He prepares jokes before lecture too. He has several office hour to answer questions/ clear doubts, although I never asked him personally--I just ask TA and some PG dailos in discord--They respond quite quickly too.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is very nice. Above 74 will be A-, above 80 will be A, and above 93 will be A+. A friend of mine scored like 20-30 in both exams and somehow he still passed as C+, quite nice indeed.<br /><br />There is also a bonus marks scheme where you post solution to the lecture notes exercise, but the marks are trivially little. By that I mean you need to post like 30 solutions first and correctly in order to earn 1 extra mark. So just work hard in exams and don&#039;t even trust this bullshit system--it was designed for you to help your peers only.<br /><br />Finally, the grade is calculated as follows. grade = max{λ homework + μ midterm + ν final : λ ∈ [0, 0.2], μ ∈ [0, 0.4], ν ∈ [0.4, 0.7], λ + μ + ν = 1} It appears this system allows you to all in final, but I do not dare to do it.",
      "comment_workload": "Originally I wanted to give a B for the workload. Generally we are given two weeks for each homework but still is a bit chur since I understand it could be quite difficult. For me, I spend a whole day, from morning to night to finish each hw (including typing latex), and it was exhausting. Ofcourse, you can form a group of 3 with your classmates to complete each hw, but I don&#039;t recommend it because it&#039;s better to complete hw on your own so that you fully digest the content.<br /><br />Ultimately I give a C for the workload, since doing homework alone will not get you a good grade. In addition, you need to complete all the lecture notes exercises, all the In-syll problems in K. Ross&#039;s book, all the tutorial questions, maybe look into a few math contest problems, spend some free time looking at calculus problems, doing HKAL past papers to develop some skills that are underdeveloped in DSE. Maybe even do ym notes (this I didn&#039;t do, I think the previous exercises are sufficient). Even so you still can&#039;t guarrantee an A+.<br /><br />As 鴨川源二 in 第一神拳 has said: 努力的人雖然不一定完全得到回報，但是!所有成功的人都是經過努力而來的!",

For people without a solid math background, e.g. Math Olympiad, the gap from high school math (e.g. DSE Math Core and M2) to the rigorousness in this course is very large, so be prepared to take some time to get used to it.",
      "comment_teaching": "----------------------------- 𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐄𝐒 -----------------------------<br /><br />The teaching is very concise and clear, but the speed is very fast. His English accent is good enough for us to follow, and he knows Cantonese as well. You are free to ask him questions after the lecture. There is usually a 5 min break in the middle of a lecture, so your brain can take a rest.<br /><br />The handwriting is done on GoodNotes with screen recording. If you cannot follow the pace, you can review the lecture by watching the video.<br /><br />The course content follows mainly Yan Min&#039;s notes, but occasionally there will be extra content with supplementary notes. Besides, there will be 1 worksheet per 1-2 lessons that demonstrates some approaches to easier problems.<br /><br />---------------------------- 𝐓𝐔𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐈𝐀𝐋𝐒 ----------------------------<br /><br />There is 1 tutorial per week, demonstrating some approaches to very difficult problems, a lot with long solutions that won&#039;t appear in homework or exams. However, I think more explanation can be done on how the solutions are achieved, instead of leaving us the impression that only experienced math students can come up with the solutions.<br /><br />------------------- 𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐈𝐄𝐖 𝐒𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 -------------------<br /><br />Before the final exam, there will be a final review session revisiting the concepts, demonstrating some problems, and going through the cheat sheet.",
      "comment_grading": "------------------------------ 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆 ------------------------------<br /><br />Take the maximum mark such that the total is 100%:<br /><br />Homework 20%<br />Midterm 10%-40%<br />Final 40%-70%<br /><br />This means you can save your midterm with your final, but not vice versa. Therefore, make sure you put enough effort into preparing for the final exam.<br /><br />The grade is decent. A range is given to people with 60% total marks or above, though I was sadly 1.25 marks from A-. You secure a B+ if you are above the mean.<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. Therefore, you can get a total of 2 total course marks (without the *20% for homework). I think it is worth the time to type LaTeX, as the 2 course marks may be saving you for a higher grade.<br /><br />You can also earn a bonus course point of 0.2 by finding and reporting a typo in Yan Min&#039;s lecture notes, homework, or homework solutions, capped at 2 points. Yan Min&#039;s notes contain a decent amount of typos, especially in computation steps, but hard to find in my opinion since the notes are quite long. In contrast, I think typos are easier to be found in Ivan&#039;s homework solutions. Some easy ones are missing a &quot;d/dx&quot; and missing a limit symbol.<br /><br />There was also 1 bonus mark given by simply asking a question for the review session.<br /><br />With the highest possible bonus course points of 5, you can get one subgrade higher, so they are worth the time completely.<br /><br />------------------------------- 𝐄𝐗𝐀𝐌𝐒 -------------------------------<br /><br />The midterm and final exams are extremely difficult, you will feel like vomiting blood during the exams. The exams kick off with a very tricky question (What is the name of the mathematician in the portrait?) (What is the meaning of some weird notation?). Then, there are a few short questions, which are already quite difficult for normal people like me.<br /><br />Then, they are followed by 2-3 computation questions which are where most people get points from. Each is worth around 10 points. For your reference, midterm has limit computations that require you to apply basic limit knowledge like sinx/x-&gt;1 as x-&gt;0 and Squeeze Theorem, while final has limit computations that require you to apply the Taylor series (very ugly and tedious). Do not use a calculator to estimate the limit as the value may be extremely large.<br /><br />Afterward, there are 2 long problems with around 4 parts each. These are the most difficult questions that I usually don&#039;t know how to do. But by writing something, regardless of correctness, the lenient T.A.s may give at least 1 mark. You can write down the approach to a problem if you failed to work out the exact details, and you will usually get more than half of the marks.<br /><br />------------------------ 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐃𝐄 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄 ------------------------<br /><br />Finally, the final exam result and letter grades are quickly released within 24 hours after the final exam, so don&#039;t check your result if you think it may affect your performance in other final exams.",
      "comment_workload": "--------------------------- 𝐇𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐊 ---------------------------<br /><br />As a student who got 5** in DSE Math Core and 5* in M2, the workload was like an 8-credit course. But given this is an honor course, I would give the workload a D.<br /><br />There were a total of 10 homework. Each homework would be released each week, containing 4 compulsory long problems and 1 optional problem with 2-4 parts each. But the deadline was usually 2 weeks later, meaning there was a week of buffer in case you cannot finish it within the first week.<br /><br />The homework problems require a lot of thinking. Therefore, it&#039;s better to form groups to work on the homework, as lots of times, you wouldn&#039;t be able to come up with a solution. Usually, the solution only takes not more than 5 steps, so if your unsuccessful attempt is overly complicated, you may be in the wrong direction.<br /><br />It took me around 5 days to complete one homework at the beginning of the course, and it gradually reduced to 3 days per week as I got used to the rigorousness.<br /><br />However, the homework was very rewarding, not only because they were intellectually stimulating, but compared to MATH 1013 difficulty, you can have a good grasp of the concepts and computations in the topic, but it was completely not enough for handling Ivan&#039;s exams.<br /><br />-------------------------- 𝐁𝐎𝐍𝐔𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐒 --------------------------<br /><br />The homework offers a bonus course point of 0.2 by submitting a LaTeX-generated .pdf file and the original .tex file instead of handwriting. This also takes a lot of time, usually within 1 day. I recommend using the online platform Overleaf - https://overleaf.com for its good editor (e.g. highlight brackets, the drop-down list for commands) and auto-save function. If your eyesight is not that good, you can use Mathcha - https://mathcha.io as it is a live LaTeX editor, i.e. you can directly edit the preview of math expressions with LaTeX instead of typing LaTeX code and then compiling it for preview.<br /><br />If you are a perfectionist, do not fixate on the beauty of LaTeX, make sure you put enough effort into other courses and balance time well while you take this beast.",

      "comment_teaching": "Ivan is a great teacher. During lessons, he doesn&#039;t just read lecture notes like a text reader. He tries his best explaining the concept to students(although sometimes some content is hard and I don&#039;t understand). He also include worksheet during lessons and demostrate how to solve a problem. However, unlike secondary school teachers(M2 teachers), He kinda teach really fast(relative to secondary school teacher). When doing WS questions, he kinda skip tons of step(once skip a HKALE level MI proof). If you think your secondary school teacher is medium to fast, then Ivan is SPEEDRUNNING. However he include (probably) many memes and anime background in zoom recording. He include SHREK&#039;S SWAMP in the background once. Also Ivan welcomes everyone asking question after lessons or during breaks(even answer outsyl 1023 questions). He have a discord server which is COOL. If you want to skip this course lessons, I encourage you. Don&#039;t skip them.<br /><br />Also TA are good too (Mr Hiu Chi Sit). His tutorial explain many ideas in solving problems. However, like Ivan, he really teach fast and skipping steps. Ask Ivan if you have questions in content. Ask TA if you want to know how to solve problems/exercises.<br /><br />BTW don&#039;t call Professor Ip Mr IP<br /><br />Ivan Ip — 2022/12/01 17:14<br />Ivan&nbsp;&nbsp;✅<br />Dr. Ip ✅<br />Prof. Ip ✅<br />イップ先生✅<br />アイヴァンさん✅<br />Mr. Ip ❌<br /><br />if you know Russian you can call him Сэр Ивaн(Ser Ivan)<br /><br />You can eat Subway sandwich with Ivan",

As a local DSE M2 normal people and not too hardworking (DON&#039;T BE TOO LAZY), and kind of &quot;mess up&quot; my final, I got a B. It is suggested to spend more time in grinding or doing questions, so you can get a higher chance to get A range.<br />Note that if you are local M2 student, don&#039;t expect you can get very high marks as there is many non local (especially mainland) tryhards. Unless you are that local genius who get 103/100 in mid term and almost full mark in final, try your best to get A range. If not (perhaps scared to have bad grade(broken🐢)) you can choose to accept you are getting B range (if you really do your best) or choose to audit (except for local IRE student who want to be math major) and take MATH1013 L1(special section which has more content than normal 1013 but less hard than 1023).<br /><br /> You all still have chance to get an A in this course (depending on your performance of final examination(I guess)).",
      "comment_workload": "As a local M2 student, workload is kind of heavy. The heavy workload isn&#039;t because of many question to do but the questions are very very hard (unless you are a genius)and the very hard exam. Overall there is 2 exams and 10 homeworks but each homework take many hours to do. Normally 1 homework has 4 questions with sub part. To perform well, It is suggested to constantly do revision. This course IS NOT DSE. 裸考 don&#039;t work and probably result in poor performance.

Instead of just knowing how to do limits, differentiation, and remember certain theorems (what taught in 1013), I can actually know the reasoning and proofs behind.<br />As a local DSE student with neither math competition experience nor self-learned everything, I did feel extreme pain switching from M2 style computation-based math to MATH 1023 style rigorousness. However, it is quite satisfying once you can understand the theorems reasonably well (Doesn&#039;t need A+ level understanding to feel this satisfaction), basically opening a new world to you and make you view mathematics differently.<br /><br />Slight criticism though:<br />The amount of content and level of difficulty (especially for Professor Ip&#039;s years) is a bit too much for a year 1 3-credit course.",
      "comment_teaching": "Obviously, the instructor is Professor Ip, or Ivan.<br />The TAs are Hiu Chi Sit and Yunhe Li.<br /><br />There are 2 80 minutes lecture and 1 50 minutes tutorial per week.<br />There will be an extra final review session.<br />Attendence will not be taken and lecture recordings will be uploaded to Canvas immediately after the lecture, so feel free to skip a lesson if you are sick.<br />Professor Ip also opened a class discord server for us, so he can release information, discuss math, or even chat casually there.<br />Note that I attended all lectures and tutorials.<br /><br />Professor Ip is a good teacher.<br />His voice is moderately loud and his tone is quite chill. His English is quite good and the accent is very audible. He handwrites notes using a digital note-taking application as he speaks, and his font is acceptable.<br />He is well prepared before he comes to class and knows the content well, and explanation of content is quite clear. Even if he made a mistake, he will make corrections as soon as possible.<br />His teaching speed is quite fast, but is still acceptable to me.<br />He often includes jokes and easter eggs (eg. uses anime scenes as his Zoom virtual background) suring lectures and in homework/ exams.<br />If you do not understand, Professor Ip welcomes anyone to ask questions after the lesson, he will explain all of them clearly (except for the time he rushed to the cinema to watch One Piece Film Red). You can also ask questions on the discord server, as Professor Ip replies very quickly (at most within few hours).<br />Bonus: As Professor Ip is also a musician, he often invites us to attend his concerts.<br />Bonus 2: If you want to, he also doesn&#039;t mind eating lunch/ dinner with his students. Feel free to invite him to LG7 and chat casually with him on math, music and ACG stuff.<br /><br />My TA was Hiu Chi Sit, so I cannot comment on Yunhe Li.<br /><br />Hiu Chi Sit is a good TA.<br />Sadly, as he is always very sleepy, his voice lacks energy and may be hypnotizing to some people (not to me though). His English is good, and the accent is very audible.<br />He handwrites notes using a digital note-taking application as he speaks, yet his font is slightly unclear but still readable.<br />Hiu Chi Sit can explain the tutorial questions quite clearly.<br />However, he also have the problem of teaching a bit too fast.<br />If you have questions, you can raise them anytime, and he do not mind answering them. And if you have a lot of problems, he will answer most of them (before he gets too tired) as he marks homework in the library/ LIFS common.<br />He is also a very caring TA, as he encouraged me to move forward and not compare with others after I told him I fried my mid term.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading is very very good.<br /><br />The grading scheme is as follows:<br />Homework: 20%<br />Midterm: 10-40%<br />Final: 40-70%<br />(Take the maximum of the weights)<br />Bonus overall course points will be given if:<br />You reported math related typos in notes, worksheets, or homework (0.2 points per typo, 2 points maximum).<br />You typed your homework using LaTex (0.2 points per homework, 2 points maximum).<br />You submitted a question in the final review session (1 points maximum).<br /><br />Note that Professor Ip and the TAs mark our homework and exam quite leniently, you get a lot of partial credits even if you can&#039;t do half of the question.<br /><br />Professor Ip adopts a partially-absolute grading system.<br />The mid term, final, and overall grade books are attached below, so I won&#039;t mention the grades too in-depth here.<br />For this semester&#039;s case, in short:<br />Overall score of 60% or above can get A-range<br />Overall score of 39.71% or above can get B-range<br />Overall score of 20% or above can get a passing grade.<br />(Mean overall score is at 52.78%, i.e. B+)<br />As you can see, the A-range and B-range are very wide.<br /><br />I expected a B+ or maybe even B from the start, but still managed to get an A- even though I was below mean in the mid term. I was very surprised when I checked my grades, and I kind of think that I do not deserve an A- (please don&#039;t take it back though). I am truly grateful for Professor Ip&#039;s generosity.",
      "comment_workload": "Workload is very heavy (to me).<br /><br />There are 1 homework with 4 long questions (and an ungraded bonus question) almost weekly, and the deadlines are set 2 weeks after release.<br />In total, there are 10 homework.<br />The homework questions are mostly quite hard, so be prepared to spend a lot of time on them.<br />In fact, I spent most of my time on MATH1023.<br />Also, it is not a shame to work with your peers, so please ask your friends for help if you do not know how to do your homework.<br />As you do your homework, you most likely need to review the course contents, so it that you effectively studied a few times as you do your homework, but it is very time consuming.<br />Please be reminded that the bonus questions are usually very hard, sometimes even those who got A or above cannot solve them, so do not be frustrated if you failed to do some of them, you are already very good.<br />Moreover, LaTex is brand new to me, and I spent quite a lot of extra time typing my homework using it.<br />At the beginning, I usually use about 6 days for each homework, and eventually the time decreased to 3 to 4 days when I got used to the contents.<br /><br />Besides homework, you also need to spend a lot of time to understand the concepts.<br />Again, don&#039;t be afraid to ask your friends/ professor/ TAs for help. I can understand most of the concepts only because I have knowledgeble friends and kind professor and TAs.<br />It should take at least 4 or 5 days of studying before each exam.<br /><br />I know that some may do extra exercise (eg. Rudin&#039;s textbook, HKALE, etc.), but homework and revision already took up most of my time, so I did not have time to find any.<br /><br />This course will mess with your study schedule, sleep schedule, reduce your freetime, and give you depression (since your classmates are very strong) to some extent, depending on your ability.<br />I personally sacrificed a lot of sleep time to finish the homework.<br /><br />To (hopefully) decrease your workload in your first fall semester, please study HKALE Pure Mathematics/ mathematical analysis as soon as possible. Although it may not help you solve Professor Ip&#039;s extra hard questions, prestudying can certainly help you understand the concepts more easily.<br />In case you are about to take this course, please kindly remind your cute 師弟師妹s, thankyou~",

      "comment_content": "Course Description:<br />&quot;This is the first in the sequence MATH 1023 – MATH 1024 of honors courses in one-variable calculus, with strong emphasis on rigorous mathematical reasoning.<br /><br />This course will cover limit and differentiation.<br /><br />Limit: limit of sequence, properties of limit, monotone sequence, Cauchy criterion, infinity, limit of function, continuous function, intermediate value theorem, invertible continuous function<br /><br />Differentiation: linear approximation, derivative, properties of derivative, monotone function, extrema, means value theorem, high order approximation, high order derivative, Taylor expansion, convex function, sketch of graph, Newton&#039;s method&quot;<br /><br />As mentioned, this course focuses on Limits and Differentiation (Integration and Series will be done in MATH1024). What&#039;s special about this course is that it emphasizes on mathematical rigor, i.e. every statement should be precisely defined or logically sound (up to some assumptions); which means the MATH1023 will focus on these points:<br />· Motivation + Observations<br />· Conceptual Understanding<br />· Logical Definitions<br />· Theorems (+Proofs)<br />· Examples &amp; Applications.<br /><br />And as you can see, it is very different than MATH1012 or 1013 since they are both mostly focused on computations,which is why the course is highly recommended to those who are planning to do a maths major (specifically pure maths) or even doing theoretical physics.<br /><br />This course is very different than school maths because it exposes you to the world of proofs and conceptual understanding of math, but it gives you a great learning experience that you won&#039;t find in any other course.",
      "comment_teaching": "Ivan is a good teacher overall. He planned his lectures well and is very well aware about the order he should be explaining about.<br /><br />In contrast to some lecturers who simply read and copy whatever the lecture notes says; Ivan, even though he uses the same lecture notes (Yan Min&#039;s lecture notes), it&#039;s clear that he puts a lot of effort in each lecture so that the session will go smoothly and fun. He&#039;s also open to questions, so don&#039;t be afraid to ask him some questions :)<br /><br />In short, he is good at teaching and also a humorous guy where you can joke around with.",
      "comment_grading": "Ivan gives two schemes in grading:<br />Homework = 20%<br />Midterm = 40% / 10%<br />Finals = 40% / 70%<br /><br />So even if you screwed your midterms, you can still make a comeback in the finals by using the 10-70 scheme! (which I personally did). But Ivan is very generous in giving grades to his students even though the questions he gave are relatively hard, about 40% of the students are in A range, which is something... Here are some statistics:<br /><br />Midterm grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 43.38<br />SD = 21.05<br />Min = 2<br />Max = 103 (wtf)<br /><br />Finals grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 46.37<br />SD = 18.95<br />Min = 8<br />Max = 97 (wtf)<br /><br />Overall grade distribution:<br />Out of 100<br />Mean = 52.78<br />SD = 21.93<br />Min = 1.06 (audit)<br />Max = 98.91 (also audit....)",
      "comment_workload": "This is an Honors course, so it should be expected that the workload will NOT be light.<br /><br />In Ivan&#039;s courses, he will give a homework in every week which consists of 4 questions (not including sub-questions + optional problem) that has a deadline of 2 weeks after the homework is released (but each homework is released every week, so the deadline is kind of 1 week -_-)<br /><br />The questions Ivan gives are interesting, you probably have never seen those questions before, solving them might take some time (if you&#039;re an average student like me) but it does give more insights to the topic, and that is what makes Ivan&#039;s 1023 special.<br /><br />Since this is an Honors course, please do make time to study if you want to have a high grade, learn from many different sources as possible, Ivan will NOT give exam questions that are like the homeworks, so you have to force yourself to be exposed to different and new questions to be prepared for his exam.<br /><br />With all that, best of luck in your 1023 journey! 👐",

However, his teaching is NOT so good - reading steps in his PPT without explaining clearly the intuitions behind those steps. You will need to self-study (= doing questions all day long) really hard to make yourself understand the methods of solving problems and making proofs. <br /><br />TAs are NOT the ones who can help you.

Other times, FF may pull inspiration from his own published papers or HKALE past paper questions. <br /><br />Truth be told, the homework are fun to solve, but not fun to do (I never thought Intermediate Value Theorem could be so hard). But overall, the homework helps me understand what the heck is going. As a deadline fighter, I would finish the homework at the day the homework was due.<br /><br />You can team up with other people for the homework, with at most 3 people I think, and your team would share the homework score.

Content is quite similar to the HKALE syllabus (except Taylor series was seemed to be excluded since 1994) but slightly more in depth because proofs will be taught in most circumstances.<br />The content is quite useful for those who are interested in major in maths, especially pure maths, since the content in the course is simply introduction to real analysis which you will encounter in year2 if you take MATHS2043.",

But do expect that you have to spend hours on just one question on the homework.<br /><br />For exams, I would say both the mid-term and final exams are pretty standard, so I believe that you can score pretty well as long as you have done the exercise. Though Prof. Xiong recommended us to do ALL the exercise in Prof. Yan&#039;s textbook, I have NOT done so because there are really too many repetitive questions in the textbook.

      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Fong&#039;s class is quite interesting, and he really is struggling to teach you better. But TA aren&#039;t always that helpful. Their problems are sometimes weird, and things you learned in class aren&#039;t helpful when solving them.",
      "comment_grading": "The grade is acceptable. Prof. Fong used several incentives to simplify the process of grading the homework, which in turn would give you more credits in the final grading. While the grade of homework depends on which TA is responsible for you.",

And if you choose not to hand in the homework in the form of Latex, then the workload is lighter again. However using latex will give you bonus.

Compared to the homework and exercises, they are relatively easy and fundamental.<br />The tutorial notes are the less serious and more interesting part of the course. XD",
      "comment_teaching": "Honestly, this course is absolutely the best in my first sem.<br />Mr. Fong is not only humorous but has been behaving quite professional, logical and reliable during the whole semester.",
      "comment_grading": "Students in this course can&#039;t really come to an agreement on this topic. <br />But for me, Prof. FONG&#039;s grading was reasonable.<br />In fact he&#039;s always been reasonable and considerate in many aspect.(Just refer to how he differed each sub-grade in the attachment)<br /><br />I get 82 for both midterm and final, with an ok-level homework(about mean, I guess.) and a little bit bonus, and end up with a safe A.<br /><br />I assume this column is in fact asking what effort is needed to get a good grade. I&#039;d directly quote what the Prof said.<br /><br />Study Tips for MATH 1023<br /><br />Rule of Thumb for all university MATH courses (not just 1023)<br /><br />Put continuous effort in the course throughout the semester! Understand all fundamental concepts by regularly attending lectures, reading lecture notes, and discussing with teaching staff and classmates. Develop your mathematical maturity and problem-solving skills through exercises and homework. Don&#039;t expect you can skip all lectures or exercises, and then &quot;爆seed&quot; by intensive/overnight revision the day before the exams! It is impossible to absorb all course materials in just one night.<br /><br />(see the meaning of &quot;爆seed&quot; here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)<br /><br />Be critical<br /><br />Don&#039;t just learn math superficially by memorizing formulae or by following homework solutions blindly. University level math, especially this honor course, emphasizes much more on logical thinking than high school math. Always ask for the reasons and make sure you are able to justify every step. Don&#039;t feel satisfied by just asking &quot;how&quot;, but ask also &quot;why&quot;, &quot;what if&quot;, &quot;under what conditions&quot;, &quot;what&#039;s good&quot;, etc. To get started, you should first change the mindset that learning math is not about memorizing or doing routine calculations.<br /><br />Be logical<br /><br />When you learn a theorem, don&#039;t just look at the &quot;formula part&quot;. It is more important to keep in mind the necessary conditions and hypotheses in order to apply those theorem. For instance, look at the statement:<br />LaTeX: \\displaystyle\\text{If } \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\text { and } \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = M, \\text{ then } \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) + g(x) = L + M. If&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) = L&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x ) = M ,&nbsp;&nbsp;then&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + g ( x ) = L + M .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Many high school students would just memorize the rule that:<br />LaTeX: \\displaystyle{\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) + g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) + \\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)} lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + g ( x ) = lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x ) + lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />but ignore the assumption that both LaTeX: \\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;lim x → a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g ( x )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to exist (and finite) in order to make use of this rule.<br /><br />In this course, you should always pay attention to the assumptions and conditions of a theorem. Ask yourself whether the theorem would fail if these conditions are not met. Furthermore, such a condition or assumption must be used somewhere in the proof, ask yourself where this condition appears in the proof and why it is needed!<br /><br />Be a good listener<br /><br />While my lectures will be based on the lecture notes, they are not merely the &quot;audio&quot; version of the notes. By just reading the lecture notes, you may only learn how to do math, but in lectures/tutorials you will learn why math is done that way, and in the long-run you will also learn the way of thinking of the instructor and TAs. Therefore, try to focus on listening and thinking during class. Taking notes (blindly) may hinder your thoughts. All blackboard notes written during a lecture will be recorded in a PDF that you can check it up later.<br /><br />Work smart (not just work hard)<br /><br />Learning mathematics -- just like learning &quot;九陰真經&quot; -- requires intensive practicing, deciphering, but not just passively by quick reading (though mathematics is not like &quot;葵花寶典&quot; that you need to &quot;sacrifice&quot; in order to learn it). Do relevant exercises soon after a lecture. Work hard and do more exercises than assigned; but work smart -- don&#039;t just do exercises of the same type over and over again. After you feel confident with basic and routine problems, go deeper on more structured and thought-provoking problems to broaden your knowledge and skills. Don&#039;t just do ALL exercises in ONE book, but do SOME exercises in SEVERAL books. Kenneth Ross&#039;s book on Elementary Analysis is a good one. Some structured problems of the deceased HKALE Pure Math were very well written -- that you can learn something new in a &quot;guided&quot; way.<br /><br />Learn from people<br /><br />Math is not fun if you learn it alone. Form a small group (such as with your highschool-mates, o&#039;camp group-mates) to study the course together. Whenever you find difficulty in a homework problem, discuss it with your friends first to exchange ideas. If the problem is still not resolved, ask instructors and TAs for hint. If you are afraid of finding the instructor and TAs alone, go together with your group.",
      "comment_workload": "If only talking about the compulsory assignments, I would give a B for Workload. But actually in this 1023 class. We were suggested to do many optional work, like Latex work, bonus questions and finding exercises by ourselves(although I personally didn&#039;t do this one).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Generally if you are adequate and aiming at doing well with a math major, you&#039;d better take Mr. Fong&#039;s suggestion seriously.",

It makes you think twice on any seemingly easy question, and think of what you actually did, instead of skipping steps all over like what I did in DSE.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a friend asking me about a limit problem and I explained to him the arithmetic rule, and the composition rule, and he don&#039;t understand. He said: What are all those rules? I didn&#039;t use those rules and I got the answer anyways. I said: You said you didn&#039;t use it because you don&#039;t know you are using it. That&#039;s why you get things wrong. You just assumes things and blindly use it (like the L&#039;Hopital&#039;s Rule). Taking MATH 1023 really made me more careful when doing problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some contents actually overlap with MATH 2033 so if you have made your way to the end of 1023, you should have an easier time in that. Professor said that some of our content is actually harder.)",
      "comment_teaching": "His teaching is good. He often make jokes in lectures which helped (at least) me focus. We often have breaks in between so we can digest what he just said and we can ask questions as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time he devoted the whole lecture talking about the application of IVT, albeit not quite related to the course, is definitely interesting if you like maths.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that the homework is much more difficult than the lectures, and professor said that the learning really only begins in the homework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tutorials are ok. Sometimes the TA prepared some questions that he have no idea how to solve, or need to use clueless complicated stuff to solve. And he sometimes can&#039;t finish the notes. There are good questions in the tutorial though.",

There are bonus if you type your homework in LaTeX (0.1 overall/homework), one bonus question (for the first five answered correctly),one bonus problem set (iPhone X eh I mean Problem set X) and some bonus if you give good reviews (idk who got it)<br /><br />Midterm (over 100 marks,)<br />Mean: 55.07, Median:55.5, Highest: 100<br /><br />Finals (over 100 marks,)<br />Mean: 65.47, Median: 64, Highest: 100 (6 students)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I got 69 marks in midterm and 89 marks in finals, so I actually used scheme B (the all-in-final scheme) and got an A. Nobody fails but one do get a D.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don&#039;t get fooled by the seeming good grade because you will get rekt by xue ba and IMO medalist!

Overall 9 problem sets (1 bonus problem set), and each consists of several computation problems (can be hard), and several high difficulty questions, then I can only say that no one can help you , not even google, except for our lord savior professor Fong or TAs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent at least 8-10 hours on each homework. (Almost) Every Thursday and Friday night I would be just hating my life, but finishing those questions give you that sense of satisfaction and joy (that&#039;s right) when you finally think of the trick needed, or done the question, that MATH 1003/1012/1013 would never be able to give you. Until next week and the cycle continues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to pwn this course, what are you smoking? But if you really do, you really need to spend time into not only the homework, but also the problems in Prof. Yan&#039;s notes, which would help you clear your concepts and learn some tricks, and extra exercise from other references.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think that you can overcome the homework (don&#039;t overlook their difficulty and time required!), then definitely take this course. You will not regret it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and by the way, the midterms and finals are open-notes and you can bring 2 notebooks, and you can use a calculator as well! Not that any of that are useful, but hey. Copy down all homework solutions ( and digest them) and you will be set for both.",

      "comment_content": "Before the midterm, the course covers the rigorous definition of limits (That is how to prove for example that the limit as x approaches a of x^2 = a^2 using well defined mathematical formulations and being rigorous while doing so). This part emphasized proofs and professor Hu Proved everything he wrote, and I mean everything. You won&#039;t be expected to repeat his proofs in the exam but you are expected to understand them since you can use a similar way to prove other questions he might ask. Also, he covers all the differentiation rules and again proofs the product rule, quotient rule, etc. After the midterm, he focused on on the applications such as optimization problems, sketching graphs, intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem, L&#039;hospital rule, local and global minima and maxima, concavity, etc. Overall, the course has a really rewarding content and I definitely recommend taking it if 1) you don&#039;t care about the grade that much and 2) if you are going to major in maths. The course has improved my mathematical maturity so much and made me think of most stuff in terms of their proofs and definitions, definitely a well constructed calculus course and is almost the same difficulty (if not harder) than other calculus courses in other US universities such as MIT and Caltech, etc.",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor Hu, for me is one of the best mathematics professors that ever thaught me in my life. He has many famous sentences such as: &quot;You don&#039;t know the definition, you get a big 0&quot; and &quot;Your intuition tells you that this limit is 0? well my intuition tells me that YOU get a 0&quot; and finally &quot;Analysis is a hard subject, every year at least 3 people commit suicide in MIT because of analysis:&quot;. Professor Hu teaching is extremely funny and laid down and you can sense he enjoys what he does, he focuses on two things: LOGIC and DEFINITION, if you lack one in your answer then you&#039;re getting a big 0. For example, the limit as x approaches infinity of (1/(x+4)) = 0 since the denominator grows to infinity and 1 divided by a very big number is 0. if you write this in the exam you get a 0. To get the mark, you can either 1) proof that the limit of 1/x+4 is indeed 0 by the DEFINITION or use logic and algebraic manipulation to write 1/x+4 as (1/x)/(1+4/x). since we know limit as x approaches infinity of 1/x = limit of 4/x&nbsp;&nbsp;= 0 and by the continuity of the polynomials, the limit is 0/(1+0) = 0/1 = 0 therefore we conclude the limit is 0. See how many steps we needed to show the limit of such an easy limit is 0? you have to follow similar arguments in ALL your answers or else, a big 0.<br /><br />A final word about the TA (Xilin Li), this is arguably one of the best TAs in the maths department, the guy is very nice, he explains things thoroughly and you can meet him after class and he would even explain FULL lessons to you after class if you need it, he is always at the maths support center most of the time and I honestly wouldn&#039;t have gotten my A- without this guy. Seriously a life saver.<br /><br />Also, for the lecture notes, review the attachments below, study from these notes since they are much harder and rigorous than the Stewart calculus book. everyone studies from it.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading is shit, no way to put it except this way. The students who take this course are all really mathematically mature and well, really really good in maths. When I went to professor Hu at the beginning of the year, I asked him if I should take the course since I am an international student and most students who take it are from mainland (if not all of them) and they are known to be the best in maths. He told me you should take it butt you might get a C or C+ even if you&#039;re good because these guys are really good, I ended up in the end getting an A- (Even though I regard myself to be exceptional in mathematics and I ranked in the top 1.8 percentile in the maths exam in my country) and I studied a lot! So if this tells you something, its that the course is full of good people, and in the end, around 40% got A- or higher and I barely hit the A- level. So be very careful if you need to maintain a certain gpa for your scholarship, I know you might really think you are very good in maths, but so did I and you&#039;re going to have to work your ass off just to get an A.<br /><br />45% midterm, 5% H.W, and 50% finals.",

      "comment_content": "A much more rigorous and a difficult course compared to math1013. The topics are actually same with math1013 but there are many proofs for you to learn thoughout the course. However, you will still get stuck with your weekly hw even you understand the proofs of the textbook. In my opinion, don&#039;t take this course if your DSE math core or m2 got lower than 5*. If you wish to take it, you will have to spend twice more time in this course than usual courses. And if you think you are really good at math in high school, you will probably change your mind after taking this course. Actually, I think this course is even more difficult than some math courses start with 2, so please think in-depth before you take this course. Its still worth to try if you really want to test yourself.",
      "comment_teaching": "Professor has a solid foundation at calculus but his teaching is not good. It takes some time to understand his English.",
      "comment_grading": "Quite bad. As a honor course, the grading should be much more better than math1013 as students are all good at math basically. Indeed, physics honor course (phys1312) has a better grade. However, the mean grade of this course is around B. (Not absolutely sure since it&#039;s heard from others)",
      "comment_workload": "The weekly hw are very difficult. Its better to know someone in class and discuss when you have difficulty. Typically it will spend 2-3 days to finish the weekly hw, and you have to spend time to understand the materials in textbook, so the workload is really heavy.",

      "comment_content": "Rigorous proof and definitions of differentiation and some integration.<br />Really advise you to have at least 5* in M2 and even 5** in Maths to have this course.<br />The first week is only the introdctory of the course and if you still dont know what he say, then go to choose 1013. Because the latter one will be more difficult.",
      "comment_teaching": "I was taught by Wu Jishan and he was bad teacher in my opinion.<br />I saw they changed the teacher in 2014 fall and the teacher now taught 1023 I think is much more better.<br />Wu Jishan will answer your questions but he will answer in a way that he was not patient and underlooked you. And he did not teach in details so I nearly skipped all the classes.",
      "comment_grading": "If you got 4t something in the course, for whole semester, you will got C or above.<br />It is very hard to get a fail in Wu Jishan scale maybe only 1 or 2. Other will get a D.<br />But as this course is in the lowest Math level and it is a pre requisite course for other maths course, please ensure yourself not having a F with you",
      "comment_workload": "Heavy in Wu Jishan teaching.<br />Every time you will have maybe 10 to 15 problems in the book but they are extremely difficult. The book sample questions are so basic and different in levels compare to the questions he chose. Hope things got better in the new lecturer.",
