During his lectures, he primarily focuses on fundamental theories that may not be directly applicable to homework and exams. However, you can find some useful things in his lecture notes and he is available to answer questions after class. Overall, I don&#039;t know why I was able to attend all his lectures.<br />Phyllis is often late to class, but provides helpful notes and clear explanations. Students should be prepared to preview the content before her lecture or tutorial, as she moves quickly. Some of the examples she provides may be difficult for beginners in the relevant content, and even more challenging than exams. Despite this, attending her lectures and tutorials is strongly recommended. It is sufficient to review Phyllis&#039;s notes before exams, as they are helpful and comprehensive.<br />There is some overlap in content between Phyllis&#039; lectures /tutorials and 水山哥&#039;s lectures, which might be a waste of time for students.",

Fortunately, I was not affected by this and received an A+ with an overall grade of 95.45(midterm 87, final 100, homework 100).<br /><br />In my opinion, it&#039;s possible to achieve a better grade than the mean, let&#039;s say 70, even with some points lost due to carelessness because 85% of the questions are basic and relevant to Phyllis&#039;s notes.

If you find anything difficult to understand, you can refer to 水山哥&#039;s notes, which provide a more fundamental explanation. Once you have a good understanding of the concepts, you can try to answer the questions and examples in Phyllis&#039;s notes on your own. After attempting the questions, it&#039;s helpful to check the answers and then summarize the methods used in the solution.

      "comment_content": "Wow, they actually did it, they have somehow managed to put every calculus thing in M2 in a 3-month course. Is it fun? I&#039;ll let you decide.<br /><br />There are mainly 2 big topics: Preface, and Actual Calculus.<br /><br />The first topic is Preface, which has a huge range of tiny stuff in it. From intervals, to composite functions, to some trigonometry stuff, and finally limits, stuff you have to understand before moving onto the actual &quot;good&quot; stuff. It can be overwhelming for some, but you really need to fully understand them (except trigo) before moving on, and there are couple ways to help with that, which I would talking more in the Workload section. Almost forgot, Squeeze Theorem and Intermediate Value Theorem, REMEMEBER THESE NAMES.<br /><br />Here comes the big daddy: Actual Calculus. This course mostly discuss about Differentiation, from first principle, to all the rules, to implict differentiation, and finally related rates and optimization. It&#039;s honestly kinda fun to work around the problem, but unless you&#039;re a psychopath like me, you might not like it as much.<br /><br />One more topic: Integration. There&#039;s honestly not a lot to talk about, only two main things to worry about: U-Substitution and fundemental theorem of calculus, and that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Overall, I do think as a 3-month course, it&#039;s a bit too much for most to handle, but if you are a psychopath who is curious about everything, I think you can have a fun time in this course. Personal view on content, B sounds pretty good.",
      "comment_teaching": "Oh boy, we got a lot to talk about.<br /><br />Professor Lam, good person. He&#039;s from Hong Kong, very good person. Something I like about him is that in lectures he always asks the right questions, for example when he was teaching L&#039;Hospital rule, he would change the questions into other formats which might be difficult to understand at a first glance, but he would slowly explain how and why it would/wouldn&#039;t work. He helped me a lot into understanding how everything works, which has a pretty big impact on me.<br /><br />Onto the next guy........, Mister Tommy, bad person, very bad person. He&#039;s also from Hong Kong, but it doesn&#039;t make him good. In his first lecture, I can already sense something is wrong. Firstly, WHY IS THE TA AN OLD DUDE? Secondly, his first sentence was &quot;A function is not just x and y&quot; which I THOUGHT he might be cooking. The food was fucking raw, he just pointed to a lot of like pure maths symbols, TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN&#039;T TAKE M2 BEFORE. I ONLY KINDA UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING CUZ I SEEM THEM ON YOUTUBE, BUT THAT DOESN&#039;T MAKE IT BETTER. Oh yeah another thing, I don&#039;t think he knows who the audience is. There was one thing he was proving trigo identities, and then he started using determinants to prove those identities? Let me rephrase it, he is using linear alegbra concepts to teach people WHO DON&#039;T EVEN KNOW WHAT LINEAR ALEGBRA IS!!!! WTF??? And then in his other tutorials and lectures, I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s a habit thing of what, after saying a bunch of gibberish, he would end the sentence with &quot;that&#039;s it&quot;, like he for sure know the audience knows what&#039;s happening. God I hate this dude.<br /><br />Overall, if you just wanna get a pass, just listen to Professor Lam, you don&#039;t need those lectures and tutorials from Mister Tommy, or another option is there are other TAs that can actually teach you something, like my friend really this Phyllis dude, highly recommend from him. Professor Lam, easy A; Mister Tommy, low D. The only reason he is not E is there are rare moments where he would say something that is quite interesting and not talk about in lectures, but unless you&#039;re trying to aim high grades, you don&#039;t need to worry about it. Speaking of grades.......",
      "comment_grading": "Here comes the bias part. I heard from a lot of people that say this course is terrible and the grading is bad, but I guess I&#039;m the lucky few who isn&#039;t really affected by it.<br /><br />There are three main assessments, homework(10%), midterm(35%), and final(55%).<br /><br />The mean of the homework is pretty high, around 90%, meaning if you want to have a safe pass, you have to get all the marks from the homework, the workload will be discuss more later.<br /><br />Onto midterm, honest reaction, I thought it was pretty easy, feels basic even. But the statistics proven me wrong. The mean was 44.31 with a s.d. of 22.28, and I got 100. Bruh. <br /><br />Final, I personally think they finally step up their games, the questions are much harder, and the statistics was shown to be true. The mean was 50.37 (s.d. not given), and I got a 94. Not bad I guess.<br /><br />The total mean is 52.2, which I think it&#039;s B? I did get an A+ with a total of 96.7, so I honestly can&#039;t judge whether the grading is bad or not.",
      "comment_workload": "Here&#039;s the thing, you&#039;re probably a science/engineering student, so you know you have other math courses to study. VERY IMPORTANT: START LEARNING ABOUT CALCULUS BEFORE LECTURES. Treat the lectures as review sessions. If you are able to do that, you will have a much better time understand what the professors are talking about. It might sounds difficult, but trust me, just use an hour or two at the end of the day to understand the basic concepts, when the lectures starts talking things that are more in-depth, you will have a good time.<br /><br />For homeworks, apparently the questions are not so easy. You do need to spend some time on them, but you will learn a lot from them after trial and error.<br /><br />For preparing midterm and final, here&#039;s a very dirty trick, instead of doing 1012 past papers, do 1013 past papers. They&#039;re basically the same course, but one of them is harder, and if you study harder past papers, you will be prepared a lot. No joke, the SAME questions were copied from 1013 to 1012, doing this helps a lot.<br /><br />Overall, you do need to spend some time on this, or else you might easily fall behind. If you hate math, I would say C or D, but if you like math, I would say B, I honestly learned a lot.",

In that case, it may be best to SKIP SKIP SKIP the lectures.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the tutor&#039;s notes and teaching style to be very helpful in MATH1012, along with resources such as YouTube.

      "comment_teaching": "課堂上略嫌他英文口音，真的真的非常影響課堂上概念的理解（其實想說不如用普通話教反而我可以catch up）所以強烈建議如果聽不明白就找herman yueng，他可以carry到你至少mean。還有，有時候因爲講起數學某概念的時候會講起關於他家人的那些東西，個人覺得沒所謂，不過可能會混亂學生的思維（因爲摻雜了其他不重要的信息）。如果克服了他的口音之後，會發現他也會很嚴謹地解釋概念，無論limit也好ddx也好，質素上不錯，但是口音真的是一個扣分點",

      "comment_workload": "大約2星期發一次功課，但其實我覺得workload還算剛剛好，通常一做就大約2小時，如果快+容易的話甚至1小時（可能是因爲我本人讀的比較多course, 其他course幾乎都是一個禮拜一份功課的時候，突然來一份數學功課的時候會崩潰o(≧口≦)o）。功課在classviva做，有無限次attempt，而且如果有些題目不會做的時候，可以有whatsapp / math center幫忙，甚至classviva裏面有給練習（附答案+解答步驟），而功課裏的題目有時候跟練習的題目類似，基本上如果會做練習的話功課都會做。<br /><br />不過有一點不好的是intergral的部分，因爲進度問題，Mr Hu在lecture有提到不會在final考，但是偏偏要求要做integral的功課（而且功課會算進你的final score，課堂上沒有教授做這份功課需要的技巧，需要靠herman yueng + 其他YouTube資源）他解釋說是math center 的決定，也是沒辦法╮（╯＿╰）╭",

However, if you have learnt some, it is okay for you to skip the lectures, which are taught at a very slow pace.<br />The tutorial is good to attend. There are 2 tutors that I will recommend are&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoi Sang KONG and Phyllis LIANG.<br />KONG Hoi Sang is also good at explaining the problems given in the tutorial notes. And in his notes, he had screened some &#039;useless&#039; questions. You don&#039;t need to waste time on classviva:) Just finish the questions in his notes.<br />Phyllis&#039; notes are good for you to clean the concept. Her lessons are fast-paced and you may get the feeling of having secondary lessons, which may be adaptable for you(?)<br /><br />Feel free to go to math support center. Those tutors are really nice to solve your problem :)",
      "comment_grading": "There was originally 1 grading scheme before the midterm.

If you want to get full marks on the long question, you may tryna read the tutorial notes&#039; answers and remember the format, they grade it strictly:)<br /><br />My result:<br />Homework:100/100 (Mean:79.55/100)<br />Mid-term:70.5/100(Mean:33.91/100)<br />Finale:92/100(Mean:58.18/100)<br />Total: 91.45(Mean:62.09/100)<br />And I got an A in this course.<br />Seems 88% can get an A, 94% A+",

He tried to teach us who never had any experience in calculus delta-epsilon proof in the 2nd week, and failed spectacularly. I’ve heard even the UG maths coordinator got involved to ‘ask’ him to be more considerate of our maths level. <br /><br />On top of this, he has very thick accent. It was very difficult to understand what he is trying to say. One of my classmates even made a whole list of words he pronounced weirdly, so that’s the only thing we can laugh about in this course I guess.<br /><br />But if you want to hear about some of his redeeming qualities, he seems like a pretty chill guy outside of class time. He is willing to share some details of his earlier life if you ask in Mandarin. Also it’s his first year teaching here, so his lack of experience is sort of expected.<br /><br />If the prof is Yin, the TA Phyllis is the Yang, more respectfully known as the hand that gives MATH1012 students another life.

Sometimes time is wasted at the beginning of the lectures to wait for people to come into zoom (~10mins to go from 30 people to 50 people)(attendance is not mandatory and zoom recordings are uploaded after each lecture).

No calculator allowed, questions were generally easier than hw. Good if you remember definitions and remember how to do basic math.",

      "comment_content": "As is known to all, this course covers basic calculus concepts, namely limits, derivatives (optimisation, rates) and integrals. Elementary topics such as trigonometry and functions are also to be discussed.<br /><br />The content itself is quite difficult to consume for students with zero M1/M2 background like me. Yet, if you are willing to do more exercises provided by TAs, I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be too overwhelming for you.",
      "comment_teaching": "The &#039;E&#039; is for the all-mighty Avery. To do him some justice, he seems like a kind guy. But you don&#039;t need to attend Avery&#039;s lessons because attendance is not counted. Another main reason is that his lectures are subpar, and his notes are utterly messy. He provides proof for each equation which are unnecessary and time-consuming, and I&#039;m sure you have all seen his bad comments everywhere, whether of UST space, LIHKG or goop. Many people complain that he speaks ~10 &#039;uuuhhhhs&#039; in each sentence, but I don&#039;t think it really matters, because he&#039;s in MATH department, right? <br /><br />I strongly suggest you revise TA&#039;s notes, which are neat and useful. For starters, you can see Phyllis Liang&#039;s notes, which can be found by searching her name on google. As for more question types, you can check out Walter Chan&#039;s notes, which can also be found on his google site.<br /><br />btw, although Phyllis&#039; accent is mainland-ish, her notes and lectures are highly useful, so do attempt (personally, I&#039;m from Phyllis&#039; group. She teaches in a slower pace which I like); Though Walter speaks in a prompt manner, he is experienced and I often find him during MSC hours because it&#039;s better for me to ask in Cantonese. Two great tutors that I strongly recommend if you are eager to improve.",

      "comment_workload": "First off, don&#039;t be scared by the credit that this course carries, because it is not accurate (some 2 credit courses are so chur) <br /><br />The good thing for 1012 is that the online homework assignments, which is done in a system called webwork, allows students to have unlimited attempts, while 1013 only has 5 attempts per question. Thus, you should get a full 25% if you do it.<br /><br />Why I gave the workload a C is that it requires time to get to know the concepts of different topics. A good way to do it is to review TA&#039;s notes, which are listed in the &#039;teaching&#039; section above.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Glad to help",

There will not be people like DickHui or Koopa Koo to help you with your Math. If you rely on the lectures/tutors alone, you will die. <br /><br />=Contents= <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Covers topics from absolute value, to limits, to differentiation and ending with integration by substitution. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the contents are overlapped by HKDSE M2. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the contents covered in this course, like L&#039;Hopital&#039;s Rule and limit to infinity, are direct prerequisite to MATH1014 (Which, if you haven&#039;t already realized, is what you will have to take next semester).

And you cannot expect to get a good grade if you start preparing a few days before the Exam. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to survive this is to go to Herman Yeung&#039;s channel and watch as many videos as possible. They will provide you with a good understanding of the concept allow you to deal with the difference types of problem. You can also check out Organic Chemistry Tutor or Khan&#039;s Academy&#039;s videos, although they tend to be on the easier side. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Work of warning: Integration is very difficult to understand so prepare AT LEAST 1 month before the exam if you are seeking an A range. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#039;t really recommend reading the textbook as the style of writing is boring and technical. You will get confused and lost easily (Although the textbook proves to be pretty useful in 1014)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing exercises is a must. You can start off by doing Walter Chan&#039;s exercise (Or those provided by the other tutors). You can also go do those in 中大出版社&#039;s M2 textbook IF YOU HAVE TIME.

(Basically pre-calculus knowledge - high school stuff but know the fundamentals)<br />Week 2 Elementary functions<br />Week 3 Tangent and velocity; the limit of&nbsp;&nbsp;a function and limit laws<br />Week 4 Continuity; limit at infinity; limit definition of derivative and rates of change<br />Week 5 Derivatives of basic functions; differentiation rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 6 Chain rule and implicit differentiation.<br />Week 7 Rates and related rates.<br />Week 8 Maximum and minimum values. (Critical Points)<br />Week 9 Derivatives and the shape of a graph; L&#039;Hopital&#039;s Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 10 Curve sketching; optimization problems<br />Week 11 Antiderivatives; areas and distance travelled<br />Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Week 13 Net change; substitution rule<br /><br />The content was very doable since I learnt more than half of it in IB SL Math so I only had to study Limits, L&#039;Hopitals Rule, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Riemann Sums. Also, I had to get used to the university style questions as they require more thought than high school questions. Study Avery&#039;s long note documents as the exam questions are very similar to that.",
      "comment_teaching": "Honestly, Avery is one of the smartest professors I have seen in HKUST but being completely honest, he can&#039;t teach. He says &quot;uhhh&quot; half the time and goes about solving questions in a way which I am not used to. Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t understand his methodology. There are much easier ways to do the questions. Alternatively, you can turn to YouTubers such as Khan Academy or PatrickJMT who are able to teach you the content in a brief and concise manner. But as aforementioned, his note documents are the key to success in his class. Do make sure you can do every question.<br /><br />However, do go for Phyllis&#039;s tutorials. She is one of the best TA&#039;s in the math department and her notes are so jeng. She has everything one must know for the topic and all sorts of difficulty of questions.",

      "comment_workload": "The workload was honestly not that heavy. I just used to do briefly look over the content since I knew the majority of it and did some practise questions to solidify my knowledge. However, if you have no background to calculus, the concept did take me a while to understand in high school so don&#039;t be afraid if you don&#039;t understand it right away.",

Most of the students in the course studied DSE and may have had a different experience than I had.<br /><br />The content up to the midterms consisted of limits and basic knowledge on derivatives. The difficulty was okay. All content on derivatives was covered in IB, and I had to learn about limits, mostly through Khan Academy, practicing past papers, and asking my peers.<br /><br />Finals suddenly got a lot more difficult and required studying to catch up, especially with the pace of how frequently Webworks were released. This is also where the part on word problems are introduced, and personally, in my opinion, those types of questions just required a degree of creativity to answer.<br /><br />Warning: This course will truly foster your HATRED for maths in the future. The effort required for most people is disproportionate to the outcome of this course.",

Despite his jolly personality during class, do not be deceived by how sadistic he is for the midterm and final exam of this course. People complain about his English and some may complain about his heavy accent, but given that this is a math course, I believe that his message is usually clear. His e-mails are written like a kindergartener though, but they inspire fear in you when you receive it as he often includes the mean and SD of the relevant assessment in the e-mail.<br /><br />Lectures are generally useless and skippable. There is a decent chance that you may doze off or fall asleep. Watching Khan Academy or videos from similar people would be more helpful in understanding contents of the course. Practicing solving and doing homework has actually taught me more than attending class as well.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t utilise the help of the T.A., Walter, but he seems to be friendly in tutorials. I also did not ask for help from the Math Support Centre because consulting them through an online environment would&#039;ve been unnecessarily difficult, so I cannot comment on my experiences with the two parties.",

I&#039;m not sure if the course used absolute grading like its sibling course, MATH 1013, but since the SD and mean of the midterm and final grades were given, it was probably curved.<br /><br />Now, for the gravely unjust grading system:<br />15% Webwork: 93.33% (mean: 93.8%; I forgot to submit on one week)<br /><br />55% Final: 11/15 (mean: 7.1 based on Canvas)<br />30% Midterm: 40/50 (mean: 24.2, SD: 11.9)<br />or<br />85% Final: 11/15 (mean: 7.1 based on Canvas)<br /><br />Final Grade: 78.33% (mean: 61.6, SD: 20.5) under Scheme 1<br />B+<br /><br />Roughly 0.75SD above for a B+. I have a friend who scored exactly 1SD above and also received a B+.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine what the letter grade for mean or below mean is. To my knowledge, 1 SD above should receive an A-.<br /><br />Furthermore, the grading of scheme 2 was absolutely illogical and stupid. This fall-term arrangement for finals had 12 multiple-choice questions overall -- 10 questions worth one point and 2 questions worth 2 points. Each student had two attempts to do the exam on Canvas. Let me just rant about how I did the computation and losing just one point was equivalent to a 5.x% decrease in the final grade.<br /><br />The printed final examination (based on the sample final) includes questions on a broader range of topics and is more indicative of one&#039;s level of understanding of the course.<br /><br />Combining the preposterous and overwhelming weight of 85%, along with the disappointing letter grade, you get MATH 1012.",
      "comment_workload": "There is Math homework on the Webwork platform that is released weekly and accounts for 15% of the final grade. Make sure to do the homework and try to score 100%. Set up a weekly reminder if you have to. If there&#039;s a question you&#039;ve been stuck on, don&#039;t be afraid to search for the answer on Google or use software like Wolfram Alpha. It&#039;s not worth it to end up forgetting about the homework entirely.<br /><br />As for the midterm and final, Math is all about practice. The lecture notes generally provide a complete overview of what you need to know. It isn&#039;t enough though, and you should definitely practice on past papers to get a feel of the exam structure and adequate pacing.<br /><br />MATH 1012 barely has any past papers. Throughout the course, students were provided only the 2015 version of the midterm and finals. In contrast, you should practice on MATH 1013 past papers. The syllabus is 90% similar to MATH 1012, with topics like linear approximation and Newton&#039;s Iteration Formula being two of the concepts excluded from the MATH 1012 syllabus. However, questions in MATH 1013 are harder, so if you are able answer them, MATH 1012 will suddenly feel easier. In addition, MATH 1013 has more sets available online with dates from 2012-2016, although not all of the exams have solution sets available to them.<br /><br />As for the midterm of this course, it was very similar to the sample MATH 1012 midterm provided to us. The breakdown of the questions by topic were almost the same -- long questions included a topic on limits, derivatives, and graphing. Multiple choice also contained questions that only had their values changed.",

      "comment_content": "This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the first in the Calculus I and II sequence, designed for students that have not taken HKDSE Mathematics Extended Module M1 or M2. Topics include functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives and rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, and basic integral calculus.<br /><br />Yes, correct, but it is not just basic in my opinion. As a student that never have been tapped in calculus, it is already very hard and advanced. (Moreover, I am weak at maths. :( )<br /><br />It is fairly acceptable before midterm, which only included some basic differentiation and trigonometric identities, (but double angle formulas are as hard as hell for me.) But once you reach the final exam, it is another stuff. The preparation for the final exam took me at least 2 whole weeks to handle well with integration by doing the exercises given by tutorial. And when I tried to do the final exam past paper, I have no idea on how to do the first long question at all! The final exam past paper given is just ridiculously hard and not able to do the long question section. Although the final exam is an open-notes, full multiple-choice question paper due to the epidemic and the difficulty is decreased, it is still challenging for a newcomer to calculus.<br /><br />The lectures teach you basic theory on calculus with simple examples. While the tutorials give you more moderate exercises. So that you can earn some confidences from them. When the exams arrive, they give you questions with 100% different from what you have done before, so that you have no idea on how to solve them, crash your confidences that you have built before, and your grade is broken.",
      "comment_teaching": "Mr Lam is good at teaching and I am fortunate to be taught by him. It is easy to understand the theory with his explanations.&nbsp;&nbsp;He will solve some webwork questions in class and it is nice. The only problem is the questions taught in class are too easy compared to exam level. And you will find a hard time if you are studying for final exam with just his notes.<br /><br />Mr Chan&#039;s tutorial notes are useful and help me to overcome a lot of basic problems compared to other tutors notes that I have done. Still, the question types are not rich enough on dealing with the exams.<br /><br />My pals keep complaining about Avery&#039;s teaching to me, but I haven&#039;t been taught by him, so it is not good for me to comment. Maybe you can try his teaching yourself(or watching other comments are already enough). :)<br /><br />It is good to point out that I only attended for the first 3 tutorials, then I had skipped all of them, as I feel like the difference is not big if you have finished all the exercises in notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I attended the first 7 lectures because I feel okay and not waste my time. But for the remaining 13 lectures(not included with 7 video lectures after November), I think I have things more meaningful(like playing and studying mahjong) rather than attending them.<br /><br />TL:DR, don&#039;t waste time on things you don&#039;t interest in and can&#039;t improve your result significantly. JUST SKIPPED THEM ALL ARE STILL FINE FOR YOUR EXAM(as you still don&#039;t do well on the exam).",
      "comment_grading": "if you are good at maths, the course is fine for you. I believe getting A is not that hard for geniuses. Even so, paying more efforts to ensure you to get high enough marks.<br /><br />If you are bad at maths like me(DSE math level 3~4), you better to be prepared to get C or B- even you did tons of exercises included sources from the internet, you just don&#039;t have enough talent to overcome the problem sometimes.<br /><br />Find some pals that you can work with and good at maths would help you a lot, start studying at least before 2 weeks the exam, and struggle with those who are not good at so you feel less painful when you don&#039;t know how to do the maths. B range can be reached if you are determined, but don&#039;t think of A, it is just fate if you can&#039;t get the thing you hope for.<br /><br />my score:<br />Midterm:35/50 (mean: 25.45)<br />Final: 12/15 (mean: 7.8)<br />webwork:100% done with 100% mark<br />I believe I get a B grade. Nevertheless, the grading of this course is shit.<br />(update: B+ turns out,no A- so sad)<br /><br />weighing methods:<br />Method 1:15%(webwork) + 30%(midterm) + 55%(final)<br />Method 2:15%(webwork) + 85%(final)",

(No offense)<br /><br />The past paper of 2015 final exam is attached for reference. I think it is extremely hard on long-question section.

However, even with only an SL math understanding, the concepts of this course can definitely be tackled with hard work and study of the textbook. <br /><br />Yet even if you do this, the questions on the exams are much harder than most you would have practised. To add onto that, Professor Avery likes to trick his students. It seems that the only way to get A+ is to work from day 1 and truly have a clear understanding of the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST FINDING THE TEXTBOOK FOR SELF-STUDY",

The attitude of one tutor who is a bit old was extraordinarily poor. When i was talking to another tutor who taught the tutorial of my session, the old tutor suddenly joined the conversation and his tone and content seemed like punishing me. Fortunately, there was a student helper who taught me patiently every time. I remember he needed to be on duty for 2 hours that day, he spended 2 hours to answer my questions and i understood the questions of the past paper completely. Otherwise, i would not ace the final exam. I was exceedingly grateful for his help but I don’t know how to contact him and thank for him, which is a pity.<br />A suggestion for you is that for a few sets of exercises concerning the calculation of differentiation, limit and integration, you can surf the internet and type differentiation calculator, limit calculator and integration calculator to help you get the answer if you don&#039;t know how to do or have no time.",

It&#039;s basically M2 stuff with a few additional theorems like the mean-value theorem and L&#039;hôpital rule. For those who have not taken M2 it could be a little bit hard to follow, so make sure don&#039;t skip any lectures, no matter how useless you think they are. Tutorials are good opportunities to have some practice and ask more &quot;technical&quot; questions, and before coming to the tutorials it&#039;s necessary to clarify the concepts in lectures first.<br /><br />Topics include:<br />♦ Functions and their graphs;<br />♦ Trigonometric functions, exponential and log functions and their inverses;<br />♥ Limits, asymptotes of graphs, continuity;<br />♥ Derivatives of elementary functions, product and quotient rules, chain rule.<br />♥ Implicit differentiations.<br />♥ Rate of changes.<br />♠ Extrema of functions. The mean value theorem.<br />♥ Increasing and Decreasing functions. Curve sketching.<br />Optimizations.<br />♠ L&#039;hôpital rule.<br />♠ Riemann sums and definite integrals.

      "comment_teaching": "CHING, Avery is a very clear-minded and logical professor, and he is able to present the basic concepts very well. However, he focuses mainly on the &quot;philosophy&quot; of maths rather than the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of how to solve mathematical problems. Sometimes he just confuses us even more as he gets more in depth in his own philosophy. If you can&#039;t catch up make sure you go to the Maths Support Center and don&#039;t be afraid to raise questions.<br /><br />CHAN, Yun Hung (TA), on the other way round, focuses on solving problems more than introducing and explaining concepts. He has a very bad Hong Kong accent, and many international students complained that they didn&#039;t understand. However it should be understandable for the locals. As time is limited he often teaches VERY fast in the lectures. Make sure you really take out a piece of paper and a pen to have a try solving the problem, but not just sit there looking as he writes. Practice determines your grade.",
