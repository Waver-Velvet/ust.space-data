      "comment_content": "The content for this course is basically about some rigorous and fundamental concepts and definitions for math. Sometimes, I think it is too rigorous, even useless. But you must take it if you are on the track of pure math.<br />I think only the equivalence relation and counting are tricky and need some time to think about and digest, others are really easy.<br />Make sure you understand some of the cardinality arithmetic to solve the proof.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching was median, for YANMIN at least. He is a nice person but sometimes cannot balance the key points well. Sometimes, he takes two weeks to introduce a trivial concept while sometimes skipping some useful ones. But his explanation is quite good and understandable.<br />However, I did not take many lectures since I think his lecture notes are very good in concept explanation and examples. So it is fine not to go to the lecture.<br />He does not have recording, very YM style.",

      "comment_workload": "WORKLOAD deserves 3 credits<br />Like a typical YANMIN course, he always lets you do the exercise in the lecture notes nearly every week, which is quite trivial but costs a lot of time. His lecture notes make lots of mistakes, so be suspected for the question.",

      "comment_teaching": "The course instructor is Professor Yan.<br />The TAs are Kailong Gao and Zhongyi Shi.<br /><br />There are 2 80 minutes lectures and 1 50 minutes tutorial per week.<br />Attendence is not taken for both lectures and tutorials.<br />Professor Yan also opened a WeChat group for us, but I did not join group.<br />Note that I attended most lectures and all tutorials.<br /><br />Professor Yan is not too good of a teacher.<br />His voice is loud and tone is ok.<br />His English is good but with slight accent.<br />He writes on the whiteboard with a marker, and font is ok.<br />He is prepared before the lesson, and gives some extra examples in addition to those in lecture notes.<br />His teaching speed is ok.<br />However, even though he tried to explain stuff clearly, he failed to do so. He often overcomplicate stuff, and I had a hard time understanding the contents. It is better to learn by yourself or wait for the TA to explain it again in the tutorials.<br />Also note that he spend most of the lecture time after the mid term on 3.6 Real Number, but decided to not examine the topic as he think it was too difficult.<br />He often make mistakes and have a lot of typos in his lecture notes (even the final exam answers are wrong!).<br />Also, he always receive phone calls (about 2 or 3 per lecture) and pauses the lecture to pick up the phone.<br />The good thing about Professor Yan is that he gives us short thinking breaks regularly, so that I actually have time to understand what he is talking about.<br />Bonus: Professor Yan invited us to hike after the mid term.<br /><br />My TA was Kailong Gao, so i cannot comment about Zhongyi Shi.<br /><br />Kailong Gao is a below mean TA.<br />His voice is loud but tone is lazy.<br />His English is meh and accent is quite heavy but still audible.<br />He writes on the whiteboard with a marker, and font is ok.<br />He explains much more clearly than Professor Yan, but unfortunately, I don&#039;t think he prepares before tutorials, as his tutorials are basically same as the lectures, and he need to look at the lecture notes before starting every new sentence. He is also quite unorganized, as he taught chapter 4 and 5 in just one tutorial at an extreme pace.<br />His teaching speed is mostly good though.<br />I also thinks that he does not communicate with Professor Yan, as Professor Yan announced that 3.7 Exponential is skipped, but Kailong Gao teaches it anyways.<br />He did welcome questions after tutorials and was quite helpful i terms of answering questions.<br /><br />In my opinion, treat the lectures as a preview, and treat the tutorials as the real lectures. Also, please learn by yourself.",

If you mess up any of them, your grade is doomed.<br /><br />Not recommended to take this course unless it is a major requirement, as it allows people who suck at proving (eg. me) to get good grade, while future IRE Math majors get B due to careless mistakes.<br /><br />Grade book attached below.",

The same goes for homework difficulty.<br />In general, each homework takes about 2 to 8 hours.<br /><br />As explanation by Professor Yan or TA are both not too clear, and some content is actually quite challenging, quite some time is needed to understand the concepts. It took me 1 or 2 days to study for the mid term and 2 to 3 days to study for the final.<br /><br />Both the mid term and final are open-book (technically open internet too as Professor Yan allowed us to use laptops and tablets, but did not check if we are using the Internet), and the difficulty of the final is lower than expected, so you could say that you &quot;do not need to study&quot;.",

      "comment_content": "Once upon a time there were MATH110 and then MATH2721, but they went dead for a long time. FF (Prof. Fong, UG coordinator) said in his blog that he brought back this course (with a new course code) to prepare students for studying maths in the future.<br /><br />Comment from others: very similar to COMP2711<br /><br />TLDR: <br />Introduction to different aspects of pure mathematics<br />Tests only include easy parts of the lecture content, also questions are ambiguous that Yan Min had to explain them several times.<br /> <br />Giving 3 hours to finish 5 straight-forward problems (which should only take around 1 hour) open-book cannot well distinguish students&#039; ability.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The course consists of 5 chapters.<br /><br />~Before Mid-term~<br /><br />1. Logic<br /><br />Statement: sadly the truth table is not introduced (indeed very useful), just be careful with logic (e.g. not (A and B) = not A or not B)<br /><br />Implication: if A then B, A =&gt; B etc. Note that this does not imply B =&gt; A. Note that this do not imply causality between A and B (despite the arrow) <br /><br />Quantifier: For all, There exists. Note that they cannot be interchanged (for all a there exists b is different to there exists b for all a)<br /><br />Proof: Proof by contradiction, basic proof such as sqrt(2) is irrational<br /><br />Induction: strong (assume true for all n&#039; &lt; n), weak (assume true for n-1), double (two variables). Note you always need to prove the base case (usually n = 1).<br /><br />No offence but if you start getting lost in this part you should drop this course and think again whether you are capable of studying maths. I don&#039;t mean that this chapter is trivial, but it is the easiest among mathematics<br /><br />2. Set and Map<br /><br />Set: Definition, Operations (union, intersection, complement, disjoint union, cartesian product) Note the operations are consistent with logics<br /><br />Map: Properties of Map, Domain, Range, Image, Pre-image. Note that you can map a set to another, instead of just element to element; Surjectivity, Injectivity, Bijectivity, (Left / Right) Inverse. Note how to use these properties (e.g. prove that f(x) is injective: f(x) = f(y) =&gt; x = y). Yan Min&#039;s proof on Bijective &lt;=&gt; Invertible is not so accurate, better to read off maths stack exchange<br /><br />Equivalence Relation: Properties, Equivalence Class, Partition, Quotient Map. TBH this part is quite confusing at first. Note that Equivalence Relation is just generalisation of equality. Two elements are equivalent if they share the same property.<br /><br />~After Mid-term~<br /><br />3. Number System<br /><br />Natural Number: Starting from Peano&#039;s Axioms, addition and order can be defined. Their trivial properties are proven from definition and induction<br /><br />Integers: Defined based on equivalence class of natural numbers.<br />Rational Numbers: Defined based on equivalence class of integers<br />Addition and Multiplication for integers and rational numbers are defined. (indeed well-defined i.e. same result with different expression of equivalence class). Later their properties are proven.<br /><br />Real numbers: Transition from Algebra to Analysis. In this course, real number is constructed from Dedekind cut (infernum of a lower-bounded set of rational numbers). Yan Min said this part is too hard and did not include it in the exam. With real numbers power can be defined (power is not taught)<br /><br />Complex numbers: we want to know what is sqrt(-1), we did it, at what cost? Well, the numbers can no longer be ordered. Very basic knowledge of complex numbers, such as definition, arithmetic, exponential, conjugate, argument, modulus<br /><br />You should try to forget basic arithmetic you have been using since primary school. As long as it is not proven, you cannot use it. Luckily for this chapter, there is only 1 problem in final, which is related to solving linear system of equations with complex coefficients. Only DSE M0 knowledge required<br /><br />5. Counting<br />Finite counting: Definition of counting, Inclusion-Exclusion Principle<br />Cardinality: comparing size of infinite sets, Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein Theorem for showing same cardinality (finding injections for both directions)<br />Countability: Define countability (finite or size of natural numbers), explain why real number is uncountable<br /><br />The only proof-type question in final is related to counting, but it only uses simple proving by contradiction technique.<br /><br />4.

Although he usually gives out breaks to give us time to understand what he say, no one understands.<br />Reading the lecture notes (sadly very confusing and full of typos, quite surprised that the notes had 20 years of history) or even Terrence Tao&#039;s Analysis 1 is more efficient. <br /><br />Also, Yan Min tends to procrastinate and mark our midterms after we finish the final.

Also, the chapter &quot;Cardinality&quot; is very difficult as you need a lot of experience to properly construct a bijective map between two given sets.<br /><br />An alternative name to this course is Foundation of Hiking.

(Especially helpful for THAT student, if you know what I mean)<br /><br />He sometimes uses weird notations to explain the content, which can be difficult to follow if you missed his explanations for them. For example, he likes to use 1-1c to represent 1-1 correspondence and a circle to represent the equivalent class of (a,b) with equal a²+b², which can be confusing. Otherwise, he explains every step detailed.<br /><br />Besides, his teaching is messy. He sometimes suddenly skips from one theorem/topic to another. He also writes messily on the whiteboard, sometimes jumping from one corner of the whiteboard to another.<br /><br />Lecture notes are updated nearly every week. This can be quite inconvenient for people without iPad or computer. But it&#039;s ok for me as I was using an iPad.<br /><br />There is inconsistent teaching and notation between Yan Min and TA.
