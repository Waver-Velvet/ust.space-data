    "name": "Reading Course: ENO and Weighted ENO Schemes",
    "description": "The Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted ENO (WENO) schemes were designed to solve hyperbolic and convection-diffusion equations that may have discontinuous solutions or sharp gradient regions. These schemes use an approximation procedure to achieve high-order accuracy in smooth regions and resolve shocks or other discontinuities sharply and without oscillations. In this course, students will review the methodology and study the applications of these schemes. Students should seek the course instructorâ€™s approval to take this course.",
