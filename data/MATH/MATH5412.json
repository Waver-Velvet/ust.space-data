      "comment_content": "There are four parts in this course:<br /><br />1. Stable law, infinitely divisible distribution (Durrett chapter 3)<br /><br />2. functional limiting thm and weak convergence of<br />random function (Convergence of probability measure chapter 2, Billingsley)<br /><br />3. Martingale and its limiting thms (Durrett chapter 5)<br /><br />4. Concentration (High dimensional probability, Roman)<br /><br /><br />The content of this course is very hardcore, especially for the first two parts. They actually require some background in analysis and point set topology. <br /><br />The concepts in the Martingale parts are easy to understand but the real life applications and modeling are extremely complicated. <br /><br />The last part of the course is the Concentration inequality, which is quite interesting and useful (in data science?).",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Bao&#039;s teachings were good! <br /><br />Sometimes Prof. Jin was also in the lesson and he suggested that Prof. Bao&#039;s teachings were too smooth, students may not have enough time to digest the martial during the lessons. I totally agree with this. <br />Please feel free to ask questions during lessons.",
      "comment_grading": "I don&#039;t know how to do some parts of few questions in the exam and finally got an A-. <br />Grades are not that important in PG courses. More important is what you learnt from the courses.",
      "comment_workload": "Only one final exam with six questions. We had a week to finish it. Not that hard but also not so easy to me.",
