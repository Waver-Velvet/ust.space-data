      "comment_content": "It should be noted that FF and Ivan&#039;s MATH2043 contain much more content than Yan Min&#039;s MATH2043, and are therefore much harder.<br /><br />Contents:<br />- Limit of sequence, function<br />- Continuity, differentiability<br />- Integration (focus on Riemann-Stieltjes integration)<br />- Improper integration, series, uniform convergence<br /><br />FF and Ivan&#039;s MATH 2043 cover much more content, including multivariable stuff and even the inverse function theorem. Yan Min reserves this for his MATH 3043.<br /><br />P.S. Yan Min&#039;s policy is that as long as you insist on taking the course, he will waiver all per-requisites for you. So don&#039;t worry if you didn&#039;t get A-range in MATH 1023/1024.",
      "comment_teaching": "Yan Min is infamous for his incomprehensible teaching, which was evident when I took his MATH 2131. However, his teaching here in MATH 2043 is surprisingly decent.<br /><br />He is clearly very passionate and puts as much an emphasis on intuition and the key ideas as the actual mathematical rigor.<br /><br />I think the main thing with Yan Min&#039;s teaching is that you need to pay very close attention. He tends to write everything he is thinking on the whiteboard without much organisation, which makes it very hard to follow his ideas if you lose track for one second.<br /><br />He gives plenty of short breaks during the lectures.<br /><br />He also holds the weekly tutorials himself, where he goes through trickier exercises from his lecture notes, and also gives mini-lectures on supplementary topics.",
      "comment_grading": "20% Homework<br />30% Midterm<br />50% Final<br /><br />After people got fxxcked by Yan Min&#039;s 26% A-range in MATH2131, it seems many people did not dare take his 2043. However, the grading in this MATH 2043 offering is actually not bad for an honors course. This might be due to the harder content, or maybe it&#039;s just there are simply fewer people (only 20 people took the course for a letter grade).<br /><br />In this semester, there were a total of -<br /><br />2 A+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;= 95.4<br />5 A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;= 87.22<br />2 A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;= 84.5<br />1 B+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;= 79.92<br />3 B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;= 69.28<br />7 B- or lower<br /><br />The lowest grade given was a C with 47.22 overall.<br /><br />So, he gives 45% A-range this semester.<br /><br />--<br />Having taken two Yan Min courses, I can say his exams usually have the following format --<br /><br />Question 1/2: Easier<br />Question 3: Hard<br />Question 4: Tedious<br /><br />Quoting Yan Min, the easier questions are there so &quot;everybody has some points&quot; :P<br /><br />Some exam problems are inspired by the homework problems he set. Out of FF, Ivan and Yan Min, Yan Min&#039;s exams are definitely the easiest.<br />--<br /><br />Homework: Mean 94.73, SD 10.04<br />Midterm: Mean 77.10, SD 15.66<br />Final: Mean 68.65, SD 20.01<br />Overall: Mean 76.40, SD 14.10<br /><br />I got 69 (nice) in the midterm and 79 in the final. Given my subpar score in the midterm, I got a B+, which I can accept. <br /><br />However, it is a bit sad that I am the only one with a B+, and I am way closer to the A- boundary than the B boundary :(",

You don&#039;t need to worry about the grading cuz the grading is generous (at least in Horror courses :P).<br /><br />FF&#039;s lecture is rewarding and he definitely won&#039;t make you disappointed. The atmosphere of his lecture is lively. He likes to tell us jokes related to physicists (if you understand...then you understand) but no one laughs anyway...(&gt;.&lt;)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA ---- Jeff, York Ye ***<br />Our TA is Jeff, York Ye. He is a genius...I have completely no idea how he can solve such complicated problems in his tutorial notes...Especially for those questions related to higher-order differentiability, the Jacobian matrices were definitely a nightmare for me...(╥╯﹏╰╥). He is a friendly TA, don&#039;t be afraid to ask any questions to him.<br /><br />There are some easier questions in his tutorial notes. FF probably will make use of some ideas in Jeff&#039;s tutorial and extend it to an exam problem. So pay more attention to the &quot;solvable&quot; questions in the tutorial. :D<br /><br />And finally, I don&#039;t know y but somehow Jeff can always find out some bugs in my Homework. He is a responsible TA that makes me feel like he grades our homework line by line with meticulous consideration. (✘_✘)",

It is possible to weigh HW 20%, Midterm 10% and Final 70%. Try to keep up in final.

But l hold a firm belief that the workload of MATH2043 is much lighter than LIFS1902 and ALL rubbish time-consuming common core, personally. So, let&#039;s preserve workload=D for physics labs and workload=E for ALL common core. _(:з」∠)_<br /><br />Good luck :)",

Differentiation | Linear and High Order Approximation in terms of unit functions<br />4. Integration | Riemann, Darboux and Lebesgue Integration (additional topic) including the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus<br />5. Topics in Analysis |Improper Integration, Series, Uniform Convergence and Exchange of Limits including some applications to IVP and Peano’s Existence Theorem (additional topics)",

Bonus marks will be given for submitting it on Latex (0.2% / HW) but doing so will significantly increase this time. The exam problems are somehow similar to the homework so you are highly encouraged to at least go over the solutions to every homework problem.",

      "comment_content": "The course mainly covers elementary analysis, following the first five chapters of the textbook Advanced Analysis written by Prof. Min Yan. Chapters 1 to 8 of Rudin&#039;s Principle of Mathematical Analysis is also a good reference to read for this course. Topics covered include:<br /><br />1. Limit and continuity<br />2. Derivative and differentiability<br />3. Riemann integrals and Darboux integrals<br />4. Uniform convergence<br />5. Existence Theorems of ODEs (Picard&#039;s Iteration, Picard-Lindelof&#039;s Existence Theorem, Arzela-Ascoli&#039;s Theorem and Peano&#039;s Existence Theorem)<br /><br />The last part is added by Prof. Fong, following Chapter 2 of his own ODE lecture notes.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teaching was excellent! Prof. Fong is very well prepared and he presented the course material in a logical and coherent way, making it easy to understand. He also proves almost all the theorems and proposition he has written down in class. In his lecture, the motivations of defining concepts and idea of proofs are very well explained.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best thing Prof. Fong did in his explanation is that he always starts with a sketch or a graph, which gives us great geometric intuition to the proof before actually writing down the proof using abstract concepts.<br /><br />The only disastrous thing about the course is the TA. I would say anyone who can fully understand his explanation deserves a Field&#039;s medal. I am super grateful that Prof. Fong was willing to teach the tutorial in person.",
      "comment_grading": "There are a few grading schemes, from which the one giving the maximum score will be taken into consideration in determining the final course grade. In order words, you can skip all the homework if you can do very well in exams. On top of this, 1% bonus point is given to students who type up their homework using LaTex.<br /><br />The grading is quite good. Two-thirds of the class got A range. I am grateful for getting an A despite poor performance in midterm and satisfactory performance in the final.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is quite heavy.<br /><br />First of all, there is a biweekly homework (altogether 5 problem sets were assigned throughout the semester). While this sounds a piece of cake, it is not the case as each problem requires deep thought before you can come up with the solution. Discussing the problems with a friend helps a lot.<br /><br />However, finishing the problem set is definitely inadequate for you to get a decent grade. So some extra practice from other books. This may take up quite a lot of your self studying time.",

So it does not matter if you perform unwell in one of the exams or homework.<br />He will also give us bonuses.<br />Due to my bad performance in midterm and homework, my grade is around the median of the class but I still got an A.

For instance, he will sometimes go beyond the course and talk about topology, which is really hard to follow.
