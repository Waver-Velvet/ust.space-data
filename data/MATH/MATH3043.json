      "comment_content": "As mentioned in my 2043 review, Yan Min teaches multivariable functions/differentiation in his 3043 instead of 2043. This means there is less time for the juicy stuff :P<br /><br />- Multivariable limit, differentiation<br />- Measure<br />- Lebesgue Integration<br />- Product Measure (Lebesgue-Stieltjes, Lebesgue in R^n)<br />- Differentiation of Measure (Radon-Nikodym theorem, Fundamental Theorem) <br /><br />Very interesting and important content, but the last two chapters were very rushed. Losing five lectures to public holidays and bad weather didn&#039;t help.<br /><br />The content is far less rich than FF or Ivan&#039;s 3043 though.",
      "comment_teaching": "After having taken Yan Min&#039;s 2131 and 2043, I think Yan Min can be a great teacher when he is not rushing. He took his time in the first few chapters, which were the chapters I understood the best immediately after the lecture.<br /><br />However, due to time constraints, he had to rush the last two chapters (Product Measure, Differentiation of Measure) and I honestly felt quite lost in these chapters.<br /><br />Regardless, it&#039;s clear he&#039;s passionate about teaching. What&#039;s for sure is I much prefer his analysis teaching to his linear algebra teaching.",
      "comment_grading": "Grading was very good this semester with 58.3% A-range given. Data is attached.<br /><br />I do have a few things to say however:<br />- The midterm contained a question which required content taught in a later course, Calculus on Manifolds.<br />- The final scores do not really differentiate students -- the lower quartile is 57, while the upper quartile is 62.5. The midterm had a much larger spread.<br />- The exams are not as &quot;failsafed&quot; as other professors like FF or Ivan. What I mean by this is that, in FF or Ivan&#039;s exam, you are often first asked to prove a useful lemma before proving a main result to guide you in the right direction. This is not only nicer for the students, but it is also instructive. It tests whether you understand how to prove, interpret and apply a new fact. With Yan Min&#039;s exams, you are just often just given the result you need to prove without further hints. If you can find the trick, then the proof is trivial. Otherwise, you are possibly doomed.",
      "comment_workload": "You will probably need to spend a lot of time to understand the content, especially in the later chapters where the teaching is quite rushed.<br /><br />There are 8 homeworks given weekly, most of which can be finished in a day. I feel like the workload is even lighter than MATH 2043 because there are far fewer exercises per homework.",

You don&#039;t need to worry about the grading cuz the grading is generous...(For 1013 L1...well...depends...⌓‿⌓)<br /><br />FF is a humorous professor and I like his teaching (and peanuts) so much :D. He sometimes proves the same direction for equality and I can never forget he mixed up the direction of Fatou&#039;s Lemma in class after saying &quot;come on! primary school stuff~~&quot; and &quot;if you know about the proof, you will still remember which one is which (direction of ≥)&quot; (＾v＾).<br />(Please don&#039;t tell FF otherwise my career will GG :P)<br /><br /><br />*** Our TA, Jeff York YE ***<br />We have the same TA in 2043 and I have to emphasize again, he is a GENIUS.

Some tutorial problems are too challenging so hilariously, FF told us a joke like &quot;yeah...should be easier than Jeff&#039;s tutorial&quot; in his lecture (≧▽≦).<br /><br />And thx god, FF didn&#039;t give us sth. like Jeff&#039;s tutorial in his exams (otherwise, at least half of the class will jump mushroom???).

Reading the proofs in FF&#039;s lecture note is time-consuming because there are too many technical proofs after midterm. (Completeness of L^p space, Egorov&#039;s Theorem, Carathéodory extension theorem, Tonelli-Fubini&#039;s Theorem, Vitali&#039;s Covering Theorem, Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Inequality, Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, Radon-Nikodym’s Theorem).<br /><br />Looking at the proofs is not enough after midterm, you have to really understand the common tricks for some of the proofs, especially for those proofs in product measure (eg. Cross-Section Method, using Monotone Class Theorem, Distributional Method).<br /><br />You may also put less emphasis on the proofs and focus on the application for some of the theorems (eg.

      "comment_content": "Multivariable Calculus: Point-set topology in R^n, Continuity/differentiability of functions F: R^n -&gt; R^m, Baire Category theorem, Implicit/Inverse function theorem...<br />(I read Spivak&#039;s Calculus on Manifold as reference, Baby Rudin Ch9 also covers most of the content)<br /><br />Measure theory and Lebesgue Integration: Follows the flow of Stein&#039;s Real Analysis Ch1-3, including important contents like <br /><br />1. The construction from outer measure (closed cube covering) to Lebesgue measure (open covering) to abstract measure (Caratheodory conditions)<br />2. Nonmeasurable set (Vitali set)<br />3. Littlewood Three Principles (Approximation of measurable set using finitely many disjoint cubes/Lusin theorem/Egorov theorem)<br />4. Construction of Lebesgue integration (simple functions -&gt; functions with Bfs -&gt; Nonnegative -&gt; General -&gt; Complex)<br />5. Interchange of limit and integration (BCT, MCT, LDCT), which are proven through the process of construction above<br />6. L^p Space, L^p norm (inequalities like Jensen inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz, Minkowski, Holder have already covered in homework of previous course)<br />7. Fubini-Tonelli&#039;s theorem <br />8. Lebesgue differentiation theorem<br />9. Vitali 3-covering lemma<br />10. Relation between bounded variation, absolute continuity, differentiability of F and integrability of F&#039;<br />(Optional class) Axiom of choice - History and relation to analysis (used in BCT and those constructions involving equivalence class, and construction of Vitali 5-covering)<br /><br />and he surprisingly included part of chapter 4 (Hilbert space) which echoes some contents in 2131. I checked that the remaining untaught part of this chapter is perfectly those involving functional analysis (bounded and continuous linear operator, Riesz representation theorem...)<br /><br />UPDATE: After reading Folland and Royden&#039;s real analysis textbook in this winter I found that sticking on Stein&#039;s textbook is rather insufficient... Some content appeared in midterm and final like convergence in measure (midterm) and convergence modes (final) can be directly found in both textbooks but absent in Stein&#039;s book...",
      "comment_teaching": "Wonderful. I can&#039;t believe that with that short period of teaching time, such an adequate amount of content is included. <br /><br />One of the most appreciated things for me is that when he started a module (mul cal/measure theory/integration/FTC/Hilbert space) he will introduce the motivation for discussing them. He also sometimes briefly talked about the motivation behind the steps for each proof.<br /><br />Also he (smartly and deliberately?) put some advanced but less applicable theorems like generalized Lagrange multiplier, converse of Lusin theorem, Steinhaus theorem, strong-type inequality... to homework, which motivated me to self-learn them through finishing the related problems.",
      "comment_grading": "Although I only got a B range (well, in both 2043 and 3043) given that I have already read the textbook once in summer, I found that my understanding for real analysis is still not all-rounded (I am too focused on the big picture instead of the technical stuff) and I think I deserve this grade.",
      "comment_workload": "Although there&#039;re only 4 hws with selected problems (4 out of 10) graded, the other ungraded ones are also important because they usually include advanced theorems (see above). Some of them are also essential contents that should study to prepare for exams.<br /><br /><br />For exams, the understanding to the contents is much important than reciting them (c.f. Kin Li&#039;s analysis according to other&#039;s reviews?) because there is even an official cheatsheet for students. Also, self-learning the contents taught in the future (well if you know) also makes you advantageous in the exam because he DID test untaught stuff that was going to teach like absolute continuity (2043), Lebesgue number lemma (2043), convergence in measure (3043) in the midterms of both courses.<br /><br />Studying counterexamples is also important for exams, but it seems that the emphasis on counterexamples is slightly deeper in 2043.",

      "comment_content": "The course roughly divides into 3 parts<br />Multivariable part (2023 materials, rigorously, and Baire Category)<br />Measure theory (Only Lebesgue measure)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Integration Theory (Dominated convergence, Lebesgue differentiation, Fubini-Tonelli (on R^n), Fundamental theorem of Calculus on Lebesgue integral)<br />Also touches a bit on Hilbert space (4061/4063) materials. <br /><br />There were a lot of materials but given this is what Professor FF calls &quot;the hardest course in HKUST undergraduate maths&quot; and even thought of having first year PGs to take this course in place of 5011 as the Analysis foundation course, you should not expect this course to be easy. You are recommended to spend at least 5-8 hours reading and doing exercises every week. Some materials to self-study would be:<br /><br />(Multivariable part)<br />Advanced Calculus by Loomis and Sternberg<br />Advanced Calculus by Fitzpatrick<br /><br />(Measure and Integration)<br />Real Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi (official)<br />Measure, Integration and Real Analysis by S. Axler (most concise and clear for first-timers)<br />Real Analysis (4th ed.) by Royden and Fitzpatrick (approaches everything in a different way so if you got stuck with the above books you can try this)",
      "comment_teaching": "Pretty much one of the best professors you can ever encounter in HKUST. His teaching were very clear, and everything is presented precisely, with many explanations, examples and intuitions. However, Ivan&#039;s pace is quite fast so you are quite recommended to self-study beforehand; if you have read the materials before, you will get a much deeper understanding of the materials during lecture.",
      "comment_grading": "Optimizes your grades based on a linear programming optimization scheme. It takes whatever is best out of 0-20% homework, 20%-50% midterm, and 40%-70% finals. The grade distribution is roughly 6A4B. So basically if you paid any form of consistent effort throughout the course, you should expect at least a B+/A-.<br /><br />(I believe the same goes for Professor Fong too)<br /><br />Midterm mean 40.9<br />Finals mean 43.1<br />Cutoff for A- is 50% total course grade and for A it is 60%",
      "comment_workload": "Fair. 4 homework sets, each take about 5 hours to 1 day to complete, and 1-3 additional hours to typeset in TeX (Latex is pretty much a requirement for Prof. FF and Prof. Ip&#039;s classes)",
