      "comment_content": "Reference book:<br />Robert Freud and Edit Gyarmati, Number Theory, <br />Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts 48, American Mathematical Society.<br /><br />The course covers basic elementary number theory (and a bit of analytic number theory) such as:<br /><br />◘ The Basics: Primes, Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, GCD and LCM.<br /><br />◘ Congruences: Modular Arithmetic, Euler&#039;s phi function, Fermat&#039;s Little Theorem, Wilson&#039;s Theorem, etc.<br /><br />◘ Congruences in polynomials: Hensel&#039;s Lemma, Primitive roots, Index, etc.<br /><br />--Midterm--<br /><br />◘ Legendre &amp; Jacobi Symbols: Quadratic congruences (x^2 ≡ a mod p), Quadratic reciprocity.<br /><br />--Makeup Midterm--<br /><br />◘ More about primes: Fermat &amp; Mersenne Primes, Dirichlet&#039;s Theorem, Prime counting function π(x), Prime number theorem (not proven, just used), applications of PNT [This chapter uses your analysis knowledge and is NOT tested on the exam].<br /><br />◘ Arithmetic functions: Multiplicative &amp; Additive functions, Some important functions (like 𝜎(𝑛), 𝜇(𝑛), 𝜔(𝑛), Ω(𝑛), and 𝑑(𝑛) ), Convolution, Mobius Inversion Formula.<br /><br />◘ Diophantine Equations: Linear Diophantine Equations, Pythagorean Triples, Gaussian Integers, Sums of Squares.<br /><br />--Finals--<br /><br />Contentwise, I don&#039;t think it fits to be a 4XXX course especially since the official course description mentioned that it contains p-adic numbers but XMS has never taught p-adic in any of his 4141 course throughout the years. <br /><br />But as someone who has no experience in number theory at all, I think it is a good introduction to number theory, it was a bit tough for me to go through this course especially since I&#039;m not that bright.<br /><br />Additionally, for some reason, XMS made the exams harder this semester compared to his previous years teaching 4141 to the point where he had to give a Makeup midterm because the midterm mean was very low (see grading)",
      "comment_teaching": "Let me be direct, XMS&#039;s lectures are very boring, I&#039;ll always fall asleep whenever I attend his lectures, so instead I self-studied throughout the course using Michael Penn&#039;s Number Theory YouTube playlist from the first chapter up to Legendre &amp; Jacobi Symbols<br />Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqwn2V9CiP7cuSGv9plj71vv<br /><br />Everything after Legendre &amp; Jacobi symbols, I watch XMS&#039;s lecture videos at 2x speed to keep me from falling asleep.<br /><br />XMS also provides lecture notes which are handwritten, although he has a neat handwriting, the structure is quite messy making it quite difficult (for me) to read unless I watch his lecture videos while looking at his notes.",

The homework has about 10 questions but we are only told to do the first 5 questions, the latter 5 can be done for practice which are recommended to do especially if you&#039;re like me having no background in NT.<br /><br />If you have NT background (say from olympiads) then this course would be very easy for you, otherwise, you&#039;d need to put in actual effort to get an A range; personally, practicing exercises from the book or XMS&#039;s past papers should suffice.",

To me, However, the teaching is kind of &quot;dry&quot; and I prefer to read them by myself or read the book directly.<br /><br />He also offers a &quot;moral lesson&quot; (same as 1023? lol) to give his though on how to deal with anxiety and stress in college life, but I think most people taking this course should be year 3 or 4... :P",

The proving questions in mt/final is more or less similar to questions in the textbook.<br />Because hint for every question is offered in the textbook, the mean for hw is very high. The mean for each quiz is around 6~7.5. I got full in midterm and 87 in final, resulting in A. <br /><br />So I think the grade is ok and you maybe need to score very high in exams to get A+, so not easy.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload depends.<br /><br />Our group was assigned 2 homeworks in the whole semester (10 selected problems from textbook each), so the homework is light.<br />Quiz is a bit annoying but the question is standard with some small tricks, and each quiz only takes 1% of the whole grade, so not a big deal.<br />But from the grading scheme, the mt and final is important and the professor suggests that we do as much exercise as possible. The textbook has tons of questions and a short hint is available for each question(only very few questions have full solutions, I guess it&#039;s because this is a new book). Sometimes hint is helpful while other times you can get nothing from it, so I just finish a portion of those questions. I think the difficulty of exams is not as much as the difficulty of the hard questions in the book.",

      "comment_content": "The content is standard for an elementary number course. If you are a pure math student, then it is advised you should take this course regardless of your specialty. <br /><br />p-adic numbers, quadratic field are not mentioned this year. Prof. Xiong presented the content in a way such that a minimal algebraic background would suffice.",
      "comment_teaching": "Prof. Xiong is very detailed and meticulous in teaching. He is explained every details very clearly with moderate pace, this could potential benefit novice. However, occasionally he just focus on trivial details, making the true meaning of theorem/formula obscure. <br /><br />The tutorial TA given is also very informative, he focus largely on numerical and concrete examples, which is nice if you&#039;re new to number theory.",
      "comment_grading": "HW: 20%, Midterm: 32%, Final: 48%. The overall score has mean around 78, with SD 20. From an objective perspective, it is not difficult to get B or above. <br /><br />When grading homework, the TA selectively grades easiest questions. I recall in an instance, we had ten questions, two of them extremely challenging. I spent a lot of time to eventually figure it out. However, the TA turns out just ignore those two questions, and only mark the easiest three problems (you can finish these 3 questions with just 6 lines). The same happens for every other assignments. Although I cannot assert whether the choice of question is intentional or a coincidence, the marking behavior severely curtail advantages of above-average students.<br /><br />Finally, the ultimate debacle is the grade Prof. Xiong gives out. He ridiculously graded by curve on a class size of just 40, and the apocalyptic consequence is that there is not a single A+. With numerous people obtaining overall marks around 98-99, the highest grade is merely only A. His transcendental way of grading amuses good and bad students alike.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is moderate, largely consists of weekly or bi-weekly assignments. Each assignment consists of around ten questions, both easy and challenging. The TA will only grade certain problems (of course you don&#039;t know which will he mark before hand). <br /><br />For midterm and final exams, the content is very straightforward and standard, time is sufficient, no trick question involved. However, you should always do as much exercises as possible.",

It maybe a bit abstract if you are not mature in Math enough and you will easily get lost in the lectures, but the problems are quite computational(in the exams). The pre-requisite is not needed essentially.",

One point is that the final covers mostly materials before midterm(maybe due to to the algebraic number theory part(Gaussian integers and primes) is sort of outside syllabus and was not tested as he emphasize this class is elementary number theory.)",
