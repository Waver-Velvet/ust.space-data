    "name": "Independent Study: Predictive Modelling with LSTM Networks",
    "description": "Construct an architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for the predictive modeling of atmospheric contamination, inclusive of meteorological variables such as wind velocity and ambient temperature. The responsibilities encompass the acquisition and pre-processing of relevant datasets, the implementation and enhancement of the LSTM framework utilizing the Python programming language and TensorFlow machine learning library, and the subsequent training and evaluation of the predictive model. The undertaking will provide experiential learning in the domains of deep learning algorithms, data preprocessing methodologies, and environmental science principles. Students should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course.",
