You can pick other programming language for the FYP.",

I have put enormous efforts in this FYP (preparation, coding, generating desired results, LATEX...) and those HW assignments. <br /><br />What I want to say is, what extent of this FYP workload depends on yours attitude, you can be pretty free if you pay cursory attention to this course and do not need a good enough grade.<br /><br />Due to putting too much time on this FYP, I have little time to prepare the final exam of other courses (This is a very BAD EXPERIENCE for me !!!! ). Please try your best to balance your time. Finally, what I want to recommand is try to enroll some easy courses for fulfillment of other credit requirement if you need to take a capstone project 4992 in that semester.
