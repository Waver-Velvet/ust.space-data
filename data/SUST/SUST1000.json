      "title": "good course",
      "comment_content": "I believe it was the most enjoyable course I took this semester. The classes were conducted in various ways, not limited to the classroom. Some classes involved going around the school to measure the flow rate of faucets, others required designing a sustainable product. There was even a class that resembled a simulated United Nations session. Additionally, the teacher arranged for us to play tabletop games developed by an environmental game company for almost an entire class (since each class lasted for 3 hours, it was a lot of fun). From the perspective of the course content, this class covers the basic principles and concepts of sustainability. It encompasses a wide range of topics, and there is a significant amount of PowerPoint content. However, the PowerPoint slides can be treated as a form of popular science material, providing informative content. The class meets once a week, and each PowerPoint presentation consists of approximately 100 pages or so of material.",
      "comment_teaching": "The teacher is very willing to answer your questions, and during group discussions, they would come around and help your group resolve any issues you encounter. They are approachable outside of class, and you can genuinely feel that they lead by example, practicing the principles of sustainability. Their way of life feels very minimalist.",
      "comment_grading": "Possibly due to the common core curriculum, my grades were pretty good. The class had a large number of students. I performed well on my midterm, and for the group assignments, one was slightly below the mean, while the other was slightly above the mean. Our group project was above the mean but not in the upper quartile. My individual essay was slightly above the mean. In the end, my grade was quite good, falling within the A range.",
      "comment_workload": "I think the workload depends on how you perceive each class. Some topics, like playing tabletop games, can be very enjoyable, so you may consider them as something fun rather than a burden. Even if a class lasts for 3 hours straight, you won&#039;t see it as a burden. The most challenging part of this course, in my opinion, is the first half of the semester when you have to sit through 3 hours of continuous lectures because the midterm exam covers that material, so it&#039;s important to pay attention. Overall, there are approximately 2 group assignments, 1 midterm, an individual essay, creating a poster, and a group project that requires preparation and presentation.",

There is also nothing to memorize as all the quizzes are open-book. Note that it is hard to score full points as there will be a mark deduction when you choose a wrong answer. <br /><br />Some people may be stressed out about scoring more in-class participation. I am also introverted and shy, but I still managed to score full marks for class participation by typing answers/ comments on Zoom and presenting our group&#039;s ideas occasionally.",

Then why the fuck bother to grade them? just change it to P/F.<br /><br />We worked so hard for the group poster and presentation, but we got below mean. Hard work does not pay off for this course. Do not take this course if you want to aim for high grades. I find this course really retarded, and professor and TA are not helpful at all. A lot of group discussions, and Professor is also kind of retarded. There was a free-rider in my group as well, and she did not act anything about this. TA never answer my email. Retarded TA. <br /><br />I assume there must be using ridiculous mark scheme when grading mid-term and posters. I will recommend you NOT to take this course, if you are a hard working person, as the grade will not reflect on how hard you work.<br /><br />Also, I have never seen teaching staff as lazy as this one. They PROMISED to release mid-term grade at least 2 weeks after the midterm examination. However, can you guess when they release grade? Fucking at early JUNE. (At least 2 weeks after exam? wtf?, then why the fuck you promise?). Can you imagine receiving midterm grade AFTER the end of semester? I have no words to say.

Do go through the ppts in advance since you can&#039;t read them all in 5 min.<br /><br />Group project: Really depends on whether you have proactive members in your group who are willing to go to extreme lengths to make your group stand out.&nbsp;&nbsp;My group was not outstanding but not bad so we received above average scores. Workload can be heavy, especially for the poster, which requires lots of group meetings as we have to collectively decide on the contents to be put on the poster. Recommended to contact students from previous years so you can see how their group products look like.<br /><br />Essay: Not difficult, if you are really interested by this course, you can do this one with ease. Just remember to submit before deadline.<br /><br />Participation: Also an exhausting component, since lots of students are always ready to raise their hands, which means you really have to stay awake throughout the class to capitalize on your chance when it comes.<br /><br />My grades:<br />Midterm: 26.5 (mean 22.78)<br />Quizzes: 15 (mean must be high, around 13-14 I guess)<br />Report 1: 4.4 (mean 4.24)<br />Report 2: 9 (mean 8.8)<br />Poster: 12.33 (mean 11)<br />Peer review, essay, participation: not published<br />Grade: B+",
      "comment_workload": "Generally high, especially after the midterm when we have to study for weekly quizzes and at the same time do the group project in November, when all courses have deadlines. The group activities in every lecture can be really exhausting, and you don&#039;t want to come into a 3hr class haven&#039;t had any sleep the night before. But after all, it was a great course.",

We had to propose a solution to solve a given country&#039;s probelms and we had to present it in form of a video.

Many groups will put much content on the &quot;poster&quot; and make it like a infographic. The professor will probably show you some good samples as reference though.",
      "comment_teaching": "Quite interesting. There are many class activities so although each lesson lasts for 3 hours, you don&#039;t feel bored. Part A of the course was taught by my own professor (i.e. Prof Lu). Part B was taught by instructors from other sessions.<br /><br />Prof. LU has a pretty strong mainland accent. However, I think it is still easy to understand what he says. He doesn&#039;t speak too fast and is quite encouraging. He wants students to participate in class but he won&#039;t force you to do so. <br /><br />Other instructors are also nice and present their materials clearly.",
      "comment_grading": "I didn&#039;t pay much effort in this course and managed to get a B+ so it&#039;s fair grading for me. Many people say you need to answer a lot of questions in class. I only answered one question throughout the whole semester but still got a good mark in participation. Midterm consisted of long questions. A bit like LS and you need to apply the concepts in real life. Group project is the most important component in this course so make sure you do it seriously.",

      "comment_content": "The course would also cover quite a lot of contents, and the concepts are mostly about geology and sustainability, yet the content is relatively easier when compared to other Common Core courses.<br /><br />The course would be divided into two parts. Part A would be explaining some key terms from the geography or anthropology field. Quite a lot of technical terms need to be memorized if you haven&#039;t studied Geography before. Part B would be covering the specific topics that are related to sustainability, such as energy consumption, fresh water usage etc. These topics are interesting as they are mostly related to daily issues. <br /><br />The course mainly consists of 2 grading parts, the project, and the midterm paper. For details, please refer to the latter part.",
      "comment_teaching": "Students are required to read a PowerPoint before going to class. The PowerPoint would be mainly about technical knowledge, which will be assessed in the midterm exam. <br /><br />The classes are interactive.

Then the group would have to present their consensus in front of the whole class.<br /><br />BTW, there is only 1 lecture per week, and each lecture would last for around 3 hours.

The only area that you could outperform in the class would be doing well in the midterm paper since the SD is quite high. If you are able to score 1-1.5 sd above the midterm paper and get a mean score for the rest, I think you are safe to get at least a B or B+.",
      "comment_workload": "The workload is not very heavy. I usually don&#039;t read the PowerPoint before class. It&#039;s OKIE to study them one to two weeks before the midterm.<br /><br />Each group would also have to complete a total of 5 research reports. They usually give out the research guidance 45 mins before the class ended and your group could complete it either within that 45 mins or after class. If the work is being evenly distributed, the workload is actually not that high.<br /><br />There is also a group project, which is to design a poster to illustrate the SDG development in a given country.",

Not difficult but need online researches. Some require submission in class, some 1 hour after class, and some 24 hours after class.<br /> A poster have to be completed based on the content in ws, and a presentation for three groups of assessor (10 min), but beware the time management and mode of assess for each grp are different.",

She loved asking questions and answering her questions could gain class participation mark as well.<br /><br />Her class was 9 am class, so it was actually quite hard for students to attend a 3 hour class per week. But, many students would attend her lessons, perhaps attendance counting was one of the reasons.<br /><br />After midterm, her colleagues would teach some topics and I did not really love it as the consistency might be affected and their other professors were actually quite creepy. Luckily I did not choose their lectures.",
      "comment_grading": "Fair grading. This semester they added Mid Term Exam which it did not appear in the past few years. So, we did not have any sources and the format was unclear as well. The weighting was too heavy and it becomes the grade differentiator since everyone gets a similar score in other components, even in the project.<br /><br />35% Mid-term Exam (23.8/35 Mean: 25.7)<br />15% Reflection Paper (11.5/15 Mean: 10.8)<br />10% Attendance and Participation (8/10 Mean: 7.4)<br />40% Group project (36.04/40 Mean: 33.5)<br />- 15% Project Worksheet (best 3 out of 4) <br />- 5% Peer Evaluation<br />- 20% Poster and Presentation<br /><br />Final Grade: B (79.3%)<br />80% B+, 4% every sub-grade",
      "comment_workload": "A 3-hour class. Only 1 lecture per week so the workload was fine.<br /><br />Have powerpoint slide before class and they expected you to read them but every chapter&#039;s slides were 80 pages long and you won&#039;t understand all of those concepts. Yet, they won&#039;t repeat too much on those concepts bruh.<br /><br />The project was fine but required students from different school and year which was a bit nonsense in some ways, yet it means that you may not be able to stick with your friends to do the project together.<br /><br />Starting from week 8, your group will have to finish a project worksheet in class. First 2 worksheets only allow you to finish within 1 hour. The last 2 worksheets have 1 day for you to finish it. Yet, the grade for every group is high.",

As a business student, it was only interesting to me was when the professor talked about how businesses can be conducted in a more sustainable manner. Real life examples are listed and some interactive and awkward exercises are conducted in class every once in a while. The content is broad, yet it sacrifices depth and it is very confusing for most students. Yet as this is a new course, it is conducted differently every semester, so please anticipate change when you register.",
      "comment_teaching": "To be frank, it&#039;s really boring unless you&#039;re all about conserving the environment. The class is conducted in an awkward manner. Don&#039;t expect much from the class; learn more via pre-assigned materials every week before class if you really want to learn. <br />Every class is 3 hours and around 1.5 hours into the class you get a tea break; the professor puts out bowls of snacks and fruits for the class to eat, which after that half of the class leaves.<br />The teaching can really be improved.<br />Attached are a few of the slides for students to read before class, which everyweek there is a new set of slides to read on and be tested on.",
      "comment_grading": "The grading system is like communism; some people work very hard for this course, some just chill and both of these people get a B range score. As the professor said, this course is graded with the absolute grading system, not relative or curve-based. Don&#039;t expect too much even though you work very hard, because if the content of your assignment does not align with the professor&#039;s views, you won&#039;t get a high score. Please take note that professor David mole studied his BA in Economics in Cambridge UK, so don&#039;t take him lightly. The bright side is, he is very generous with giving out Bs.",
      "comment_workload": "In comparison to the other courses in HKUST, this course has a rather light workload. Once in a while, there will be an important assignment; which for my course, it was 5 in-class quizzes (25%), 2 reflection papers (each paper requires about 800 words), a group project which only requires you to present in less than 2 minutes.<br />No attendance needed. Grading doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re active or not. No mid-terms, No finals. Just don&#039;t be too lazy and submit your assignments on time.",
